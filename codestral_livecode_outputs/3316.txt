Problem ID: 3316
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.
The power of a subsequence is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.
Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4]. The sum of powers is |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
The only subsequence in nums which has length 2 is [2,2]. The sum of powers is |2 - 2| = 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation:
There are 3 subsequences in nums which have length 2: [4,3], [4,-1], and [3,-1]. The sum of powers is |4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n == nums.length <= 50
-10^8 <= nums[i] <= 10^8 
2 <= k <= n

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a problem that can be classified as "Dynamic Programming" and "Sorting". Its difficulty level is Medium to Hard because it involves understanding dynamic programming concepts and optimizations along with sorting an array.

    The main challenge in this problem is finding the sum of powers of all subsequences of length k, which requires a good understanding of both sorting and dynamic programming. Since we need to find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in each subsequence, sorting the array will help us solve this part efficiently. After that, we can use dynamic programming to calculate the sum of powers for all possible subsequences.

    As for required programming skills, this problem requires knowledge about arrays, loops, conditional statements, sorting algorithms (preferably quicksort or mergesort), and dynamic programming. A basic understanding of modulo operations would also be beneficial since we need to return the sum modulo 10^9 + 7.

    In terms of complexity, the time complexity is O(n^2 * log(n)) due to sorting and the nested loops in the dynamic programming solution. The space complexity is O(k) for storing the subsequences and O(n) for the array used in dynamic programming, making it overall O(n^2). However, since n can be up to 50, this should be manageable within reasonable time limits.
