Problem ID: 3364
Problem Content:
You are given two arrays nums and andValues of length n and m respectively.
The value of an array is equal to the last element of that array.
You have to divide nums into m disjoint contiguous subarrays such that for the i^th subarray [l_i, r_i], the bitwise AND of the subarray elements is equal to andValues[i], in other words, nums[l_i] & nums[l_i + 1] & ... & nums[r_i] == andValues[i] for all 1 <= i <= m, where & represents the bitwise AND operator.
Return the minimum possible sum of the values of the m subarrays nums is divided into. If it is not possible to divide nums into m subarrays satisfying these conditions, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2], andValues = [0,3,3,2]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The only possible way to divide nums is:

[1,4] as 1 & 4 == 0.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[2] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.

The sum of the values for these subarrays is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,7,7,5], andValues = [0,7,5]
Output: 17
Explanation:
There are three ways to divide nums:

[[2,3,5],[7,7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 5 + 7 + 5 == 17.
[[2,3,5,7],[7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.
[[2,3,5,7,7],[7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.

The minimum possible sum of the values is 17.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], andValues = [2]
Output: -1
Explanation:
The bitwise AND of the entire array nums is 0. As there is no possible way to divide nums into a single subarray to have the bitwise AND of elements 2, return -1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^4
1 <= m == andValues.length <= min(n, 10)
1 <= nums[i] < 10^5
0 <= andValues[j] < 10^5

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem with bit manipulation. The problem requires dividing an array into multiple subarrays such that the bitwise AND of the elements in each subarray is equal to a given value. This type of problems often involves complex state transition and optimization, which makes them difficult compared to simpler algorithmic tasks.

   To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with bitmasking. The main idea is to iterate through all possible states (subsets) of the numbers in 'nums' array using a bitmask. We also need to keep track of the maximum subarray value for each state and the number of operations left.

   Difficulty: Hard
   Skills Required: Dynamic Programming, Bit Manipulation
   Complexity: The time complexity is O(N*2^M) where N is the length of 'nums' array and M is the length of 'andValues' array. This is because we have to iterate through all numbers in 'nums' for each possible state. The space complexity is O(2^M), as this will be used to store the results for each subset of operations.
