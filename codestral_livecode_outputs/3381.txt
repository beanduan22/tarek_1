Problem ID: 3381
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums of non-negative integers and an integer k.
An array is called special if the bitwise OR of all of its elements is at least k.
Return the length of the shortest special non-empty subarray of nums, or return -1 if no special subarray exists.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
The subarray [3] has OR value of 3. Hence, we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,8], k = 10
Output: 3
Explanation:
The subarray [2,1,8] has OR value of 11. Hence, we return 3.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2], k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation:
The subarray [1] has OR value of 1. Hence, we return 1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= k < 64

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem falls into the category of array and bit manipulation problems. It can be solved using a sliding window approach to find the shortest subarray that meets the given condition (bitwise OR of all elements is at least k). To solve this problem, you need to know how to apply bitwise operations in programming and understand the concept of sliding windows for solving array-based problems efficiently. The difficulty level of this problem can be considered EASY as it requires basic knowledge of array traversal and bitwise operations. However, the complexity may slightly increase if the constraints are larger due to a higher number of elements or larger possible values of integers.
