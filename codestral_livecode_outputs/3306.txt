Problem ID: 3306
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of size n consisting of positive integers.
You are also given a 2D array queries of size m where queries[i] = [index_i, k_i].
Initially all elements of the array are unmarked.
You need to apply m queries on the array in order, where on the i^th query you do the following:

Mark the element at index index_i if it is not already marked.
Then mark k_i unmarked elements in the array with the smallest values. If multiple such elements exist, mark the ones with the smallest indices. And if less than k_i unmarked elements exist, then mark all of them.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the sum of unmarked elements in the array after the i^th query.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1], queries = [[1,2],[3,3],[4,2]]
Output: [8,3,0]
Explanation:
We do the following queries on the array:

Mark the element at index 1, and 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 8.
Mark the element at index 3, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 3 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 3.
Mark the element at index 4, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 0.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,3], queries = [[0,1]]
Output: [7]
Explanation:  We do one query which is mark the element at index 0 and mark the smallest element among unmarked elements. The marked elements will be nums = [1,4,2,3], and the sum of unmarked elements is 4 + 3 = 7.

 
Constraints:

n == nums.length
m == queries.length
1 <= m <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
queries[i].length == 2
0 <= index_i, k_i <= n - 1

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the problem description, it falls into the category of "Advanced" problems in algorithmic programming, specifically related to data structures like arrays and priority queues. It requires understanding and proficient use of advanced algorithms, such as query handling and sorting techniques. The problem also involves maintaining a state of the array after each operation which adds an additional layer of complexity.

    The predicted category for this problem is:
    - Difficulty: Advanced
      Reasoning: The problem requires understanding and proficient use of advanced algorithms, along with maintaining a state of the array after each operation. It's not suitable for beginners who are just starting to learn about these concepts.
    - Required Programming Skills: Priority Queues (heap), Data Structures (Arrays), Algorithms (Sorting, Query Handling)
      Reasoning: The problem can be solved by maintaining a priority queue of unmarked elements and performing operations based on the queries. It requires understanding of data structures like arrays to store the elements, and knowledge of algorithms such as sorting for managing the priority queue and query handling.
    - Complexity: High
      Reasoning: The problem has a time complexity that can be up to O(n log n) because of the use of a priority queue (heap), where 'n' is the size of the array, and it may require sorting depending on the implementation. The space complexity could also be high due to the use of extra data structures for maintaining the unmarked elements.
