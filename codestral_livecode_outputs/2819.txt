Problem ID: 2819
Problem Content:
Given a positive integer num represented as a string, return the integer num without trailing zeros as a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = "51230100"
Output: "512301"
Explanation: Integer "51230100" has 2 trailing zeros, we remove them and return integer "512301".

Example 2:

Input: num = "123"
Output: "123"
Explanation: Integer "123" has no trailing zeros, we return integer "123".

 
Constraints:

1 <= num.length <= 1000
num consists of only digits.
num doesn't have any leading zeros.

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the given information:

- The problem is about manipulating strings that represent positive integers. This requires knowledge of string handling in programming.
- The task involves removing trailing zeros from a number represented as a string. To do this, we can iterate over the string from its end and stop when we encounter a non-zero character. This should be relatively easy to implement but might require careful handling of indices.
- The constraints suggest that the input could be quite large (up to 1000 digits), which may require more efficient algorithms or considerations for time complexity if not handled properly.

Based on these factors, I'd predict this problem to be of medium difficulty. It does not seem overly complex in terms of required algorithmic skills and should be solvable with a basic understanding of string manipulation. However, the presence of large inputs could potentially make it slightly more challenging.
