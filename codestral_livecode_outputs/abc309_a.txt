Problem ID: abc309_a
Problem Content:
We have the following 3 \times 3 board with integers from 1 through 9 written on it.

You are given two integers A and B between 1 and 9, where A < B.
Determine if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

Print Yes if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1 \le A < B \le 9
- A and B are integers.

Sample Input 1

7 8

Sample Output 1

Yes

The two squares with 7 and 8 written on them are adjacent horizontally, so print Yes.

Sample Input 2

1 9

Sample Output 2

No

Sample Input 3

3 4

Sample Output 3

No

    Difficulty: Easy

    The problem is about determining whether two given integers on a 3x3 board are adjacent horizontally. This involves taking two integer inputs (A and B) and checking if they differ by exactly one, and also if their quotient when divided by 3 gives the same result. If both conditions are met, then the numbers are adjacent horizontally.

    Programming Skills Required: Basic knowledge of conditional statements and arithmetic operations is required to solve this problem.

    Complexity: The time complexity of the solution would be O(1), as it involves a few simple mathematical calculations and conditional checks that do not depend on the size of the input. Therefore, the solution can handle the provided constraints efficiently.
