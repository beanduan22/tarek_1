Problem ID: 3372
Problem Content:
You are given an array of integers nums. Return the length of the longest subarray of nums which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The strictly increasing subarrays of nums are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], and [1,4].
The strictly decreasing subarrays of nums are [1], [2], [3], [3], [4], [3,2], and [4,3].
Hence, we return 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The strictly increasing subarrays of nums are [3], [3], [3], and [3].
The strictly decreasing subarrays of nums are [3], [3], [3], and [3].
Hence, we return 1.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The strictly increasing subarrays of nums are [3], [2], and [1].
The strictly decreasing subarrays of nums are [3], [2], [1], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1].
Hence, we return 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem falls under the category of dynamic programming or sliding window algorithm. It's a moderate level problem because it requires thinking about subarray manipulation and tracking variables.

   The difficulty arises from handling both strictly increasing and decreasing subsequences. A simple approach may involve iterating through the array twice, once for each sequence direction. However, this solution isn't efficient as it doesn't take advantage of the fact that we can determine whether a new element is in an increasing or decreasing trend from the previous elements without checking all potential sequences.

   The required programming skills include understanding arrays and looping constructs. A more advanced skill set might involve knowledge of dynamic programming, but this isn't strictly necessary to solve the problem because we can achieve our solution with a single pass through the array while maintaining only two variables to track state (the length of the current increasing subsequence and the length of the current decreasing subsequence).

   The complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This is because we perform a single loop over the array, comparing each element with its predecessor to determine if it's part of an increasing or decreasing subsequence.
