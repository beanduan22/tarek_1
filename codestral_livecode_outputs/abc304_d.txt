Problem ID: abc304_d
Problem Content:
There is a rectangular cake with some strawberries on the xy-plane. The cake occupies the rectangular area \lbrace (x, y) : 0 \leq x \leq W, 0 \leq y \leq H \rbrace.
There are N strawberries on the cake, and the coordinates of the i-th strawberry are (p_i, q_i) for i = 1, 2, \ldots, N. No two strawberries have the same coordinates.
Takahashi will cut the cake into several pieces with a knife, as follows.

- First, cut the cake along A different lines parallel to the y-axis: lines x = a_1, x = a_2, \ldots, x = a_A.
- Next, cut the cake along B different lines parallel to the x-axis: lines y = b_1, y = b_2, \ldots, y = b_B.

As a result, the cake will be divided into (A+1)(B+1) rectangular pieces. Takahashi will choose just one of these pieces to eat. Print the minimum and maximum possible numbers of strawberries on the chosen piece.
Here, it is guaranteed that there are no strawberries along the edges of the final pieces. For a more formal description, refer to the constraints below.

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem is a competitive programming challenge that can be categorized as follows:

Category: Range Query / Prefix Sum / Data Structures
Difficulty: Medium-Hard
Skills Required: Implementation of algorithms for range query problems, efficient data structures like prefix sums or segment trees, sorting and binary search techniques.
Complexity: The complexity of this problem can vary depending on the chosen solution approach. A brute force approach could lead to O(N^3) time complexity due to checking all possible rectangles formed by cuts on cake. More efficient approaches such as using prefix sums or segment trees will yield better results with a complexity of around O((A + B + N) log (A + B + N)).

To solve this problem, we could follow these steps:
1. Read the input data for width and height of the cake, strawberries positions, cut lines on x-axis and y-axis.
2. Store all the x and y coordinates along with the cut lines in one array, sort it to have an ordered list of points.
3. Create a prefix sum grid based on this sorted list of points. This will help us count strawberries within any range (x1, x2) x (y1, y2) efficiently.
4. Traverse through all possible rectangles formed by the cut lines and find the rectangle with minimum and maximum number of strawberries.
5. Output the minimum and maximum numbers of strawberries on the chosen piece.

Remember that since there are no strawberries along the edges, we can safely ignore the first and last rows or columns of the prefix sum grid when finding the min/max values to remove empty rectangles from our calculation.
