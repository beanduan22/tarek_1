Problem ID: abc314_d
Problem Content:
You are given a string S of length N consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
Let us perform Q operations on the string S.
The i-th operation (1\leq i\leq Q) is represented by a tuple (t _ i,x _ i,c _ i) of two integers and one character, as follows.

- If t _ i=1, change the x _ i-th character of S to c _ i.
- If t _ i=2, convert all uppercase letters in S to lowercase (do not use x _ i,c _ i for this operation).
- If t _ i=3, convert all lowercase letters in S to uppercase (do not use x _ i,c _ i for this operation).

Print the S after the Q operations.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
S
Q
t _ 1 x _ 1 c _ 1
t _ 2 x _ 2 c _ 2
\vdots
t _ Q x _ Q c _ Q

Output

Print the answer in a single line.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq5\times10^5
- S is a string of length N consisting of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
- 1\leq Q\leq5\times10^5
- 1\leq t _ i\leq3\ (1\leq i\leq Q)
- If t _ i=1, then 1\leq x _ i\leq N\ (1\leq i\leq Q).
- c _ i is an uppercase or lowercase English letter.
- If t _ i\neq 1, then x _ i=0 and c _ i= 'a'.
- N,Q,t _ i,x _ i are all integers.

Sample Output 1

atcYber

Initially, the string S is AtCoder.

- The first operation changes the 4-th character to i, changing S to AtCider.
- The second operation converts all lowercase letters to uppercase, changing S to ATCIDER.
- The third operation changes the 5-th character to b, changing S to ATCIbER.
- The fourth operation converts all uppercase letters to lowercase, changing S to atciber.
- The fifth operation changes the 4-th character to Y, changing S to atcYber.

After the operations, the string S is atcYber, so print atcYber.

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem is a string manipulation problem which falls under the category of basic to intermediate level problems in programming. It requires understanding of string data structure, arrays and loops for iterative operations.

    The problem statement describes performing Q operations on an initial string S with length N. Each operation is represented by a tuple (t, x, c), where t can have values from 1 to 3 that define the type of operation to be performed. If t is 1, we need to change the character at position x in the string to c; if t is 2, we convert all lowercase characters in S to uppercase, and if t is 3, we convert all uppercase characters in S to lowercase.

    To solve this problem, we can use an array or list to store the initial string S and then iterate over the operations from Q to perform the required changes on the string S. For each operation, based on the value of t, we can modify the string S accordingly. After performing all Q operations, we print the final modified string S.

    The complexity of this problem is O(N+Q) as we need to iterate over the initial string S once and then perform Q operations which might involve modifying certain characters in S based on the value of t in each operation. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of S and the number of operations Q.

    This problem can be solved using various programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. The choice of programming language depends on the programmer's preference and familiarity with that language.
