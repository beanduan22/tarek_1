Problem ID: abc340_c
Problem Content:
There is a single integer N written on a blackboard.
Takahashi will repeat the following series of operations until all integers not less than 2 are removed from the blackboard:

- Choose one integer x not less than 2 written on the blackboard.
- Erase one occurrence of x from the blackboard. Then, write two new integers \left \lfloor \dfrac{x}{2} \right\rfloor and \left\lceil \dfrac{x}{2} \right\rceil on the blackboard.
- Takahashi must pay x yen to perform this series of operations.

Here, \lfloor a \rfloor denotes the largest integer not greater than a, and \lceil a \rceil denotes the smallest integer not less than a.
What is the total amount of money Takahashi will have paid when no more operations can be performed?
It can be proved that the total amount he will pay is constant regardless of the order in which the operations are performed.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print the total amount of money Takahashi will have paid, in yen.

3

Sample Output 1

5

Here is an example of how Takahashi performs the operations:

- Initially, there is one 3 written on the blackboard.
- He chooses 3. He pays 3 yen, erases one 3 from the blackboard, and writes \left \lfloor \dfrac{3}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 and \left\lceil \dfrac{3}{2} \right\rceil = 2 on the blackboard.
- There is one 2 and one 1 written on the blackboard.
- He chooses 2. He pays 2 yen, erases one 2 from the blackboard, and writes \left \lfloor \dfrac{2}{2} \right\rfloor = 1 and \left\lceil \dfrac{2}{2} \right\rceil = 1 on the blackboard.
- There are three 1s written on the blackboard.
- Since all integers not less than 2 have been removed from the blackboard, the process is finished.

Takahashi has paid a total of 3 + 2 = 5 yen for the entire process, so print 5.

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a mathematical problem that can be solved using recursive calculations. The problem falls under the category of "mathematical" problems, specifically "number theory". It requires good understanding of integer division operations and their properties. The difficulty level is moderate to hard since it involves complex recursive calculations with large numbers. Programming skills required include basic arithmetic operations, recursion, and handling large numbers. The problem's complexity can be considered as O(log N) because each operation halves the number, which means the number of operations will be proportional to log base 2 of N.
