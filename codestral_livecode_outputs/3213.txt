Problem ID: 3213
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums and a positive integer k.
Return the number of subarrays where the maximum element of nums appears at least k times in that subarray.
A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarrays that contain the element 3 at least 2 times are: [1,3,2,3], [1,3,2,3,3], [3,2,3], [3,2,3,3], [2,3,3] and [3,3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,1], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: No subarray contains the element 4 at least 3 times.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= k <= 10^5

 Category: Sliding Window/Two Pointers

     Explanation: This is a moderate level problem that requires understanding of array manipulation and sliding window techniques. The main challenge lies in determining the number of subarrays where the maximum element appears at least k times. This can be solved using two pointers or a sliding window technique, which are commonly used to solve problems involving contiguous sequences in an array. However, it is important to note that the constraint on the size of the array (10^5) suggests the need for an efficient solution to pass within reasonable time limits. Overall, this problem falls under the moderate difficulty level, and candidates should be proficient in handling arrays and have experience with sliding window/two pointers algorithms.
