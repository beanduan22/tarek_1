Codestral Analysis:
 The problem falls under the category of "String Manipulation" or "Basic Programming". It is a beginner-level problem that requires basic knowledge in handling strings and simple looping constructs to iterate through the string and remove specific characters.

    Here's how the solution can be approached:
    1. Initialize an empty string, let's call it `result`.
    2. Iterate over each character in the given input string `S`.
    3. If the current character is not a vowel (i.e., it is not 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', or 'u'), append it to the `result` string.
    4. After iterating over all characters in `S`, print the `result` string.
