Problem ID: abc344_b
Problem Content:
You are given N integers A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N, one per line, over N lines. However, N is not given in the input.
Furthermore, the following is guaranteed:

- A_i \neq 0 ( 1 \le i \le N-1 )
- A_N = 0

Print A_N, A_{N-1},\dots,A_1 in this order.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1
A_2
\vdots
A_N

Output

Print A_N, A_{N-1}, \dots, A_1 in this order, as integers, separated by newlines.

Constraints


- All input values are integers.
- 1 \le N \le 100
- 1 \le A_i \le 10^9 ( 1 \le i \le N-1 )
- A_N = 0

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is a simple input/output operation where we are given N integers as input, one per line. However, N is not explicitly given in the input. We are also guaranteed that no integer will be equal to 0 except for the last input which is always 0. The task is to print these numbers in reverse order, i.e., from A_N to A_1.

This problem can be solved using basic programming skills and does not require any advanced concepts or algorithms. It tests the ability to read and store input data, as well as iterate through a list of data in reverse order. The complexity of this problem is linear, O(N), because we need to process each integer once.
