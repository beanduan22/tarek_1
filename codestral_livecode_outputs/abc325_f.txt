Problem ID: abc325_f
Problem Content:
As the factory manager of Keyence, you want to monitor several sections on a conveyor belt. There are a total of N sections you want to monitor, and the length of the i-th section is D_i meters.
There are two types of sensors to choose from, and below is some information about each sensor.

- Type-j sensor (1\leq j \leq 2): Can monitor a section of length L_j meters.
The price is C_j per sensor, and you can use at most K_j sensors of this type in total.

You can divide one section into several sections for monitoring.
It is fine if the sections monitored by the sensors overlap, or if they monitor more than the length of the section you want to monitor.
For example, when L_1=4 and L_2=2, you can use one type-1 sensor to monitor a section of length 3 meters, or use one type-1 and one type-2 sensor to monitor a section of length 5 meters.
Determine whether it is possible to monitor all N sections, and if it is possible, find the minimum total cost of the necessary sensors.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
D_1 D_2 \dots D_N
L_1 C_1 K_1
L_2 C_2 K_2

Output

If it is impossible to monitor all N sections, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum total cost of the necessary sensors.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 100
- 1\leq D_i,L_j \leq 10^5
- 1\leq C_j \leq 10^9
- 1\leq K_j \leq 10^3
- All input values are integers.

Sample Output 1

17

You can monitor all sections by using three type-1 sensors and four type-2 sensors as follows.

- Use one type-1 sensor to monitor the first section.
- Use one type-1 and one type-2 sensor to monitor the second section.
- Use one type-1 and three type-2 sensors to monitor the third section.

In this case, the total cost of the necessary sensors is 3\times 3 + 2\times 4 = 17, which is the minimum.

It is fine if one type of sensor is not used at all.

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem falls under the category of dynamic programming with constraints or optimization problems. The difficulty level can be considered MEDIUM_HARD as it involves understanding and applying concepts from dynamic programming to solve an optimization problem under certain constraints. One needs to have a good grasp on mathematical reasoning, implementation of algorithms, and handling large data efficiently.

    Here is the breakdown:

    1. The problem deals with monitoring sections on a conveyor belt using sensors, which can be seen as an optimization problem where we are looking for the minimum cost solution.
    2. There are multiple sections to monitor and each section has its length. A sensor can monitor a certain range of lengths and there is a price associated with it.
    3. The constraint in this problem is that the total number of sensors of any type should not exceed a given limit (K).
    4. Since we have to find the minimum cost, it's clear that we need to explore all possible combinations to ensure optimality. This suggests that dynamic programming might be an appropriate strategy to solve this problem.
    5. Dynamic programming is used to solve optimization problems by breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and using the results of these subproblems to solve larger ones.

    Hence, this problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem with optimization constraints.
