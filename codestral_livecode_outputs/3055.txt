Problem ID: 3055
Problem Content:
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.
You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.
Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.
Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".

Example 2:

Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of '0' and '1'.
s contains at least one '1'.

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a medium-difficulty level problem in the field of string manipulation and sorting algorithms. It requires a good understanding of binary strings and their representations. The main challenge lies in rearranging the bits to create the maximum odd number.

    The problem is not complex but it does require logical thinking and a bit of creativity to approach it. The solution involves counting the number of '1's and '0's in the string, placing all the '1's at the end except for one which should be placed at the beginning to make the number odd. The remaining positions will be filled with '0's.

    This problem does not require advanced programming skills but it tests basic problem-solving and logical thinking abilities. It can be solved in different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++ etc., by using built-in functions or manual looping through the string to count '1's and '0's.
