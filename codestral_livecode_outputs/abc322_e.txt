Problem Content:
AtCoder Inc. is planning to develop a product. The product has K parameters, whose values are currently all zero. The company aims to raise all parameter values to at least P.
There are N development plans. Executing the i-th development plan (1 \le i \le N) increases the value of the j-th parameter by A_{i,j} for every integer j such that 1 \le j \le K, at the cost of C_i.
A development plan cannot be executed more than once. Determine whether the company can achieve its goal, and if it can, find the minimum total cost required to achieve the goal.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K P
C_1 A_{1,1} A_{1,2} \dots A_{1,K}
C_2 A_{2,1} A_{2,2} \dots A_{2,K}
\dots
C_N A_{N,1} A_{N,2} \dots A_{N,K}

Output

If AtCoder Inc. can achieve its goal, print the minimum total cost required to achieve the goal; otherwise, print -1.

Constraints


- 1 \le N \le 100
- 1 \le K,P \le 5
- 0 \le A_{i,j} \le P(1 \le i \le N,1 \le j \le K)
- 1 \le C_i \le 10^9(1 \le i \le N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

4 3 5
5 3 0 2
3 1 2 3
3 2 4 0
1 0 1 4

Sample Output 1

9

If you execute the first, third, and fourth development plans, each parameter will be 3+2+0=5,0+4+1=5,2+0+4=6, all of which are at least 5, so the goal is achieved. The total cost in this case is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.
It is impossible to achieve the goal at a total cost of 8 or less. Thus, the answer is 9.

Sample Input 2

7 3 5
85 1 0 1
37 1 1 0
38 2 0 0
45 0 2 2
67 1 1 0
12 2 2 0
94 2 2 1

Sample Output 2

-1

You cannot achieve the goal no matter what you do. Thus, print -1.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is a classic optimization problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or bitmasking. Here's how to analyze it:

- This is an intermediate level problem in terms of difficulty. It requires knowledge of algorithms and data structures, specifically dynamic programming techniques for optimization problems.
- The problem involves several variables (N development plans, K parameters) and a goal value (P). The task is to determine the minimum cost to reach this goal by choosing a subset of development plans. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, which can be solved using dynamic programming.
- The main challenge in this problem is managing the dependencies between different development plans and parameters. For example, executing one plan might increase the value of some parameters but not others, and reaching the goal for one parameter may require choosing multiple plans.
- To solve this problem, we can use a bitmask to represent the state of each parameter (whether it has reached its goal or not). We then iterate through all possible subsets of development plans, updating the minimum cost to reach each state using dynamic programming. Finally, we return the minimum cost to reach the desired state.
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N*2^K), where N is the number of development plans and K is the number of parameters. This is because there are 2^K possible states (one for each combination of parameters reaching their goal or not) and we need to iterate through all N plans for each state. The space complexity is O(2^K), since we store the minimum cost for each state in a dynamic programming array.
