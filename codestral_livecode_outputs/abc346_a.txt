Problem ID: abc346_a
Problem Content:
You are given N integers A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N.
Also, define B_i = A_i \times A_{i+1}\ (1 \leq i \leq N-1).
Print B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{N-1} in this order, separated by spaces.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N

Output

Print B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{N-1} in this order, separated by spaces.

Constraints


- 2 \leq N \leq 100

Codestral Analysis:
 Category: Basic Programming (Array Manipulation)
   Difficulty Level: Easy
   Programming Skills Required: Basic knowledge of arrays and loops in any programming language.
   Complexity: The time complexity is O(N), as we only need to iterate through the given array once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with input size.
