Problem ID: 3353
Problem Content:
Given a string s, find any substring of length 2 which is also present in the reverse of s.
Return true if such a substring exists, and false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: true
Explanation: Substring "ee" is of length 2 which is also present in reverse(s) == "edocteel".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcba"
Output: true
Explanation: All of the substrings of length 2 "ab", "bc", "cb", "ba" are also present in reverse(s) == "abcba".

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcd"
Output: false
Explanation: There is no substring of length 2 in s, which is also present in the reverse of s.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be classified as a string manipulation problem that requires knowledge of working with strings in a programming language and understanding basic concepts of string reversal and substring extraction. Its difficulty level is Easy to Medium. This problem does not require advanced data structures or algorithms; therefore, it should be solvable even for individuals who are new to programming.

The complexity of this problem can be analyzed as follows:

- Time Complexity: O(n^2) - Since we are iterating through the string 's' and for each character, we are checking all possible substrings of length 2. Here 'n' is the length of the string 's'.

- Space Complexity: O(1) - We are not using any extra space that scales with the input size. The size of the data structures used here (like variables) does not change as the input size increases.
