Problem ID: 2827
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and you are allowed to traverse between its indices. You can traverse between index i and index j, i != j, if and only if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor.
Your task is to determine if for every pair of indices i and j in nums, where i < j, there exists a sequence of traversals that can take us from i to j.
Return true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: true
Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,9,5]
Output: false
Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,12,8]
Output: true
Explanation: There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a programming problem that falls under the Graph Theory / Connectivity category with a MEDIUM level of difficulty. The problem can be solved using Union-Find data structure or Depth-First Search (DFS).

In this problem, we are given an array of integers and allowed to traverse between its indices based on the condition that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numbers at two different indices is greater than 1. The task is to determine if for every pair of indices in the array, there exists a sequence of traversals that can take us from one index to another.

Programming skills required: Knowledge of graph theory and understanding of Union-Find data structure or Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

Complexity Analysis: The time complexity is O(n^2 log m), where n is the length of the array and m is the maximum value in the array, as we might need to find the gcd for every pair of numbers which takes O(log m). The space complexity is O(n) for storing parent and rank arrays.

The problem can be considered MEDIUM-HARD level due to its graph theory application and the required programming skills to solve it optimally, although there are solutions available that can solve this problem in O(n log n) time complexity using Union-Find data structure.
