Problem Content:
AtCoder cafeteria offers N main dishes and M side dishes. The price of the i-th main dish is A_i, and that of the j-th side dish is B_j.
The cafeteria is considering introducing a new set meal menu.
A set meal consists of one main dish and one side dish. Let s be the sum of the prices of the main dish and the side dish, then the price of the set meal is \min(s,P).
Here, P is a constant given in the input.
There are NM ways to choose a main dish and a side dish for a set meal. Find the total price of all these set meals.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M P
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N
B_1 B_2 \dots B_M

Output

Print the answer as an integer.
Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proved that the answer fits into a 64-bit signed integer.

Constraints


- 1\leq N,M \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq A_i,B_j \leq 10^8
- 1\leq P \leq 2\times 10^8
- All input values are integers.

- If you choose the first main dish and the first side dish, the price of the set meal is \min(3+6,7)=7.
- If you choose the first main dish and the second side dish, the price of the set meal is \min(3+1,7)=4.
- If you choose the second main dish and the first side dish, the price of the set meal is \min(5+6,7)=7.
- If you choose the second main dish and the second side dish, the price of the set meal is \min(5+1,7)=6.

Thus, the answer is 7+4+7+6=24.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about calculating the total price of all set meals in a cafeteria that offers N main dishes and M side dishes. Each dish has a specific price, and a set meal consists of one main dish and one side dish with a total price equal to the minimum of the sum of their prices and a given constant P. To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible combinations of main dishes and side dishes, calculate the price for each combination, and then sum up these prices.

Category: Algorithms > Implementation, Mathematics
Difficulty: Medium-Hard
Required Programming Skills: Basic understanding of loops, arrays, and math operations.
Complexity: The time complexity is O(N*M) because we need to iterate through all N main dishes and M side dishes. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the total price and the current dish prices.
