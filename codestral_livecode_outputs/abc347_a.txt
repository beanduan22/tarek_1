Problem Content:
You are given positive integers N and K, and a sequence of length N, A=(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N).
Extract all elements of A that are multiples of K, divide them by K, and print the quotients.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \ldots A_N

Output

Divide all elements of A that are multiples of K and print the quotients in ascending order with spaces in between.

Constraints


- 1\leq N,K\leq 100
- 1\leq A_1 < A_2 < \ldots < A_N \leq 100
- A has at least one multiple of K.
- All given numbers are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 2
2 5 6 7 10

Sample Output 1

1 3 5

The multiples of 2 among the elements in A are 2, 6, and 10. Divide them by 2 to get 1, 3, and 5, and print them in ascending order with spaces in between.

   Difficulty: Easy to Medium

   Explanation: The problem is about filtering elements from a given sequence that are multiples of a provided integer, dividing them by the same integer and printing the quotients. This involves input/output operations for reading data, looping over the elements in the sequence, using conditional statements to check if an element is divisible by K, and performing mathematical operations. The problem doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms, making it a basic programming problem.
