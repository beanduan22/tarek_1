Problem ID: 3402
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums and two integers cost1 and cost2. You are allowed to perform either of the following operations any number of times:

Choose an index i from nums and increase nums[i] by 1 for a cost of cost1.
Choose two different indices i, j, from nums and increase nums[i] and nums[j] by 1 for a cost of cost2.

Return the minimum cost required to make all elements in the array equal. 
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,1], cost1 = 5, cost2 = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: 
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,2].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,3].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,4].

The total cost is 15.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,3,5], cost1 = 2, cost2 = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] and nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [3,4,3,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,4,4,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,4,4,4,5].
Increase nums[1] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5,4,5].
Increase nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 2. nums becomes [5,5,5,5,5].

The total cost is 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,5,3], cost1 = 1, cost2 = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,5,3].
Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,3].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,4].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5].

The total cost is 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= cost1 <= 10^6
1 <= cost2 <= 10^6

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the provided information:

The problem involves an array of integers and two costs for different operations that can be performed any number of times to make all elements in the array equal. This is a dynamic programming problem with a slight twist, as it involves making decisions based on two different types of operations. The difficulty level seems to be moderate-hard because of its complexity and the need to consider multiple aspects to come up with an optimal solution.

To solve this problem, it's necessary to have strong skills in dynamic programming concepts, array manipulation, and optimization techniques. Furthermore, since the array can have up to 10^5 elements, the algorithm should be able to handle large input efficiently.
