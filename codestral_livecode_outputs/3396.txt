Problem ID: 3396
Problem Content:
A word is considered valid if:

It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
It contains only digits (0-9), and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
It includes at least one vowel.
It includes at least one consonant.

You are given a string word.
Return true if word is valid, otherwise, return false.
Notes:

'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercases are vowels.
A consonant is an English letter that is not a vowel.

 
Example 1:

Input: word = "234Adas"
Output: true
Explanation:
This word satisfies the conditions.

Example 2:

Input: word = "b3"
Output: false
Explanation:
The length of this word is fewer than 3, and does not have a vowel.

Example 3:

Input: word = "a3$e"
Output: false
Explanation:
This word contains a '$' character and does not have a consonant.

 
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 20
word consists of English uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, '@', '#', and '$'.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about validating a given string according to certain rules. It falls under the category of "String Manipulation" and "Basic Data Validation".

Difficulty: Easy

Required Skills: Familiarity with string data type, regular expressions or pattern matching in programming language, understanding basic conditional statements.

Complexity: Time complexity is O(n) as we're traversing the string once. Space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used that scales with input size.

Here is a Python solution using regular expressions and set data structure:

```python
import re
def valid_word(word):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    consonants = set('bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ')

    if len(word) < 3 or not re.match("^[A-Za-z0-9]*$", word):
        return False

    has_vowel = any((char in vowels for char in word))
    has_consonant = any((char in consonants for char in word))

    return has_vowel and has_consonant
```
The function `valid_word(word)` checks if a given string is valid according to the rules provided. It first checks the length of the word and if it only contains digits and English letters. Then, it checks if the word includes at least one vowel and one consonant. The function returns True if all conditions are met, otherwise, it returns False.
