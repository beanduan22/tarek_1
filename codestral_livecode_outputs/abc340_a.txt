Codestral Analysis:
 The problem can be categorized as a "Basic Programming" problem. It requires understanding of arithmetic sequences and the ability to use loops in programming.

   Here is the analysis:

   Difficulty Level: Beginner to Intermediate

   Skills Required: Basic knowledge of programming, specifically loops (like for or while loop) and basic mathematical operations. Understanding of how arithmetic sequences work would be beneficial but not necessarily required.

   Problem Complexity: This problem is moderately easy. Given that an arithmetic sequence exists, all we need to do is calculate the terms in the sequence based on the given first term, last term, and common difference. The complexity of this solution depends on the number of terms in the sequence. In the worst case scenario (when A = 1, B = 100, D = 1), there are 100 terms in the sequence which would require looping through 100 times. However, it's important to note that for most practical cases, this won't be a problem as the number of terms will be significantly less.

   In conclusion, this is a basic programming problem that can help develop foundational skills in loop implementation and mathematical operations. It doesn't require advanced algorithms or data structures to solve, making it suitable for beginners.
