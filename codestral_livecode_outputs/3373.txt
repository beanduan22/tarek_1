Problem ID: 3373
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums.
Return an integer that is the maximum distance between the indices of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers in nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,9,5,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: nums[1], nums[3], and nums[4] are prime. So the answer is |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,8,2,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums[2] is prime. Because there is just one prime number, the answer is |2 - 2| = 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
The input is generated such that the number of prime numbers in the nums is at least one.

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the provided information:

- The problem involves working with an array of integers and finding two prime numbers within it. The goal is to find the maximum distance between these two primes by calculating the absolute difference in their indices. This requires a good understanding of arrays, loops, and conditional statements.
- Additionally, the problem includes constraints such as the length of the input array and the range of values in the array. These constraints suggest that an efficient solution is required to solve the problem within reasonable time limits, which may involve using algorithms or data structures optimized for handling large datasets.
- The requirement to work with prime numbers adds a layer of complexity to the problem, as this requires implementing an algorithm to check if a number is prime. However, given that the maximum value in the array is 100, a simple iterative approach could be used to check for primality.
- Overall, I would categorize this problem as "medium" in difficulty due to the need for working with arrays and handling prime numbers, while also requiring an efficient solution to meet the constraints on input size.
