Problem ID: 2878
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a positive integer k.
You can apply the following operation on the array any number of times:

Choose any subarray of size k from the array and decrease all its elements by 1.

Return true if you can make all the array elements equal to 0, or false otherwise.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,3,1,1,0], k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose the subarray [2,2,3]. The resulting array will be nums = [1,1,2,1,1,0].
- Choose the subarray [2,1,1]. The resulting array will be nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0].
- Choose the subarray [1,1,1]. The resulting array will be nums = [0,0,0,0,0,0].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make all the array elements equal to 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a sliding window problem with array manipulation elements in it. The level of difficulty for this problem is medium because it requires a good understanding of array manipulations and sliding windows concepts.

    To solve this problem, the key insight is to utilize a sliding window technique where we keep track of the sum of each subarray of size k. We can calculate the difference between the current element and its predecessor in order to determine how much decrease should be applied to the next elements. If the difference is positive, it means that we need to decrease the elements to make them zero, otherwise, there's no need for decrementation.

    During this process, if any operation leads to a negative difference (indicating more decrements than available numbers), then it's impossible to make all array elements equal to 0. On the other hand, if we can successfully perform these operations and end up with an array of zeroes, then it's possible.

    The time complexity is O(n) because we need to traverse each element in the given array once where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for storing temporary variables.

    In terms of required programming skills, this problem tests your ability to manipulate arrays and perform logical calculations using if-else statements. It also requires understanding of sliding window technique that is commonly used in array problems.
