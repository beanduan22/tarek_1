Problem ID: 3235
Problem Content:
You are given two 0-indexed strings source and target, both of length n and consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].
You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.
Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: source = "abcd", target = "acbe", original = ["a","b","c","c","e","d"], changed = ["b","c","b","e","b","e"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
Output: 28
Explanation: To convert the string "abcd" to string "acbe":
- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.
- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.
- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.
- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

Example 2:

Input: source = "aaaa", target = "bbbb", original = ["a","c"], changed = ["c","b"], cost = [1,2]
Output: 12
Explanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.

Example 3:

Input: source = "abcd", target = "abce", original = ["a"], changed = ["e"], cost = [10000]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.

 
Constraints:

1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5
source, target consist of lowercase English letters.
1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000
original[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.
1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6
original[i] != changed[i]

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a graph theory problem that falls under the medium to hard level of difficulty. It requires proficiency in handling strings and arrays, as well as implementing a suitable algorithm for shortest path computation. The complexity of this problem can be considered high due to the size constraints of the input strings (up to 10^5) and the number of cost transformations (up to 2000). A possible approach could be creating a weighted graph using the given costs, then applying Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford's algorithm to find the shortest path from each character in source string to every character in the alphabet, and finally use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for converting the source string to the target string. This solution will have a time complexity of O(n*m^2) or O(n*m*log(m)), where n is the length of the strings and m is the number of possible characters in the alphabet (26).
