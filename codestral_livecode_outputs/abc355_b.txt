Problem ID: abc355_b
Problem Content:
You are given a sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N) of length N and a sequence B=(B_1,B_2,\dots,B_M) of length M. Here, all elements of A and B are pairwise distinct. Determine whether the sequence C=(C_1,C_2,\dots,C_{N+M}) formed by sorting all elements of A and B in ascending order contains two consecutive elements appearing in A.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N
B_1 B_2 \dots B_M

Output

If C contains two consecutive elements appearing in A, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N, M \leq 100
- 1 \leq A_i, B_j \leq 200
- A_1, A_2, \dots, A_N, B_1, B_2, \dots, B_M are distinct.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3 2
3 2 5
4 1

Sample Output 1

Yes

C=(1,2,3,4,5). Since 2 and 3 from A occur consecutively in C, print Yes.

Sample Input 2

3 2
3 1 5
4 2

Sample Output 2

No

C=(1,2,3,4,5). Since no two elements from A occur consecutively in C, print No.

Sample Input 3

1 1
1
2

Sample Output 3

No

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a simple sorting and searching algorithm problem. The difficulty level is easy to moderate, as it requires the ability to sort two arrays and search for consecutive elements from one array in the merged sorted array. To solve this problem, no advanced programming concepts or techniques are required. The main challenge lies in understanding the problem statement correctly and translating that into code.

    In terms of complexity, merging two arrays and sorting them takes O(N log N + M log M) time. However, since N and M are limited to 100, this can be considered as a linear time operation for practical purposes. Searching for consecutive elements from one array in the merged array is a linear scan that takes O(N+M) time.

    Overall, solving this problem requires basic programming skills, such as understanding how to read input, sort arrays, and search for elements. The complexity of the solution is also manageable given the constraints on the input size.
