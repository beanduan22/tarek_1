Problem Content:
Takahashi's cake has been eaten by someone. There are three suspects: person 1, person 2, and person 3.
There are two witnesses, Ringo and Snuke. Ringo remembers that person A is not the culprit, and Snuke remembers that person B is not the culprit.
Determine if the culprit can be uniquely identified based on the memories of the two witnesses. If the culprit can be identified, print the person's number.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

If the culprit can be uniquely identified based on the memories of the two witnesses, print the person's number; otherwise, print -1.

Constraints


- 1 \leq A, B \leq 3
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

1 2

Sample Output 1

3

From the memories of the two witnesses, it can be determined that person 3 is the culprit.

Sample Input 2

1 1

Sample Output 2

-1

From the memories of the two witnesses, it cannot be determined whether person 2 or person 3 is the culprit. Therefore, print -1.

Sample Input 3

3 1

Sample Output 3

2

   Explanation: This is a basic problem that tests understanding of logic and decision-making. Given two pieces of information (who the witnesses remember was not the culprit), the task is to determine if there's enough information to identify the culprit uniquely among three suspects. The solution involves checking all possible scenarios based on the witness statements and using an 'if-else' structure to make a decision.

   This problem can be solved with basic programming skills, particularly in logic and control flow. It does not require advanced data structures or algorithms and is relatively simple to understand and implement. The complexity of this problem is O(1), as there are only three suspects to consider, and the solution involves a fixed number of operations regardless of input size.
