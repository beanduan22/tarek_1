Problem ID: 3451
Problem Content:
Given a string word, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string comp. While word is not empty, use the following operation:

	
Remove a maximum length prefix of word made of a single character c repeating at most 9 times.
Append the length of the prefix followed by c to comp.



Return the string comp.
 
Example 1:

Input: word = "abcde"
Output: "1a1b1c1d1e"
Explanation:
Initially, comp = "". Apply the operation 5 times, choosing "a", "b", "c", "d", and "e" as the prefix in each operation.
For each prefix, append "1" followed by the character to comp.

Example 2:

Input: word = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaabb"
Output: "9a5a2b"
Explanation:
Initially, comp = "". Apply the operation 3 times, choosing "aaaaaaaaa", "aaaaa", and "bb" as the prefix in each operation.

For prefix "aaaaaaaaa", append "9" followed by "a" to comp.
For prefix "aaaaa", append "5" followed by "a" to comp.
For prefix "bb", append "2" followed by "b" to comp.


 
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the provided information, I can analyze the problem as follows:

Category: String Manipulation
Difficulty: Medium
Required Programming Skills: Basic understanding of strings, loops, conditional statements
Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string 'word'

This is a problem related to string manipulation. It requires iterating over the given string and compressing it according to certain rules, i.e., appending the count of consecutive identical characters followed by the character itself. This can be solved using a single pass through the string. The problem does not involve any complex data structures or algorithms; therefore, it is classified as a medium-level problem.

However, one important aspect to note is that the constraints provided (1 <= word.length <= 2 * 10^5) suggest that an efficient solution with time complexity better than O(n^2) might be required for larger inputs.

So, based on these analyses, I would categorize this problem as String Manipulation and its difficulty level as Medium to Hard due to the constraint of handling large input sizes efficiently.
