Problem ID: abc319_c
Problem Content:
There is a 3\times3 grid with numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive, written in each square. The square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1\leq i\leq3,1\leq j\leq3) contains the number c _ {i,j}.
The same number may be written in different squares, but not in three consecutive cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
More precisely, it is guaranteed that c _ {i,j} satisfies all of the following conditions.

- c _ {i,1}=c _ {i,2}=c _ {i,3} does not hold for any 1\leq i\leq3. 
- c _ {1,j}=c _ {2,j}=c _ {3,j} does not hold for any 1\leq j\leq3.
- c _ {1,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {3,3} does not hold.
- c _ {3,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {1,3} does not hold.

Takahashi will see the numbers written in each cell in random order.
He will get disappointed when there is a line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) that satisfies the following condition.

- The first two squares he sees contain the same number, but the last square contains a different number.

Find the probability that Takahashi sees the numbers in all the squares without getting disappointed.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
c _ {1,1} c _ {1,2} c _ {1,3}
c _ {2,1} c _ {2,2} c _ {2,3}
c _ {3,1} c _ {3,2} c _ {3,3}

Output

Print one line containing the probability that Takahashi sees the numbers in all the squares without getting disappointed.
Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-8}.

Constraints


- c _ {i,j}\in\lbrace1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\rbrace\ (1\leq i\leq3,1\leq j\leq3)
- c _ {i,1}=c _ {i,2}=c _ {i,3} does not hold for any 1\leq i\leq3. 
- c _ {1,j}=c _ {2,j}=c _ {3,j} does not hold for any 1\leq j\leq3.
- c _ {1,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {3,3} does not hold.
- c _ {3,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {1,3} does not hold.

Sample Output 1

0.666666666666666666666666666667

For example, if Takahashi sees c _ {3,1}=2,c _ {2,1}=2,c _ {1,1}=3 in this order, he will get disappointed.

On the other hand, if Takahashi sees c _ {1,1},c _ {1,2},c _ {1,3},c _ {2,1},c _ {2,2},c _ {2,3},c _ {3,1},c _ {3,2},c _ {3,3} in this order, he will see all numbers without getting disappointed.
The probability that Takahashi sees all the numbers without getting disappointed is \dfrac 23.
Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-8}, so outputs such as 0.666666657 and 0.666666676 would also be accepted.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about calculating the probability that a person sees numbers in a 3x3 grid without getting disappointed. The grid contains unique numbers from 1 to 9 such that no three consecutive cells (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) contain the same number. The person gets disappointed if they see the same number twice in a row/column but then see a different number next. To solve this problem, we need to calculate all possible permutations of seeing the numbers and filter out the ones that cause disappointment.

    Problem Category: Probability, Combinatorics, Permutation Generation

    This problem falls into the category of probability and combinatorics. It requires a good understanding of calculating probabilities and generating all possible permutations of an event. The problem can be considered medium in difficulty due to its mathematical complexity but doesn't require advanced programming skills unless the implementation involves optimization techniques like memoization or dynamic programming for performance enhancement.
