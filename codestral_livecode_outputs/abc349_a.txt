Problem Content:
There are N people labeled 1 to N, who have played several one-on-one games without draws. Initially, each person started with 0 points. In each game, the winner's score increased by 1 and the loser's score decreased by 1 (scores can become negative). Determine the final score of person N if the final score of person i\ (1\leq i\leq N-1) is A_i. It can be shown that the final score of person N is uniquely determined regardless of the sequence of games.

Here is one possible sequence of games where the final scores of persons 1, 2, 3 are 1, -2, -1, respectively.

- Initially, persons 1, 2, 3, 4 have 0, 0, 0, 0 points, respectively.
- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -1, 0, 0 point(s).
- Persons 1 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 0, -1, 0, 1 point(s).
- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -2, 0, 1 point(s).
- Persons 2 and 3 play, and person 2 wins. The players now have 1, -1, -1, 1 point(s).
- Persons 2 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 1, -2, -1, 2 point(s).

In this case, the final score of person 4 is 2. Other possible sequences of games exist, but the score of person 4 will always be 2 regardless of the progression.

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a beginner to intermediate level problem that falls under the category of Mathematics & Algorithms. The problem can be solved using basic arithmetic operations and doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms. However, understanding the problem statement and applying mathematical reasoning to find the pattern in scores are crucial for solving this problem.

    Here's a simple solution:

    1. Read the input values of N (number of players) and Ai (scores of players 1 to N-1).
    2. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array Ai.
    3. Since each game involves a winner gaining +1 point and loser losing -1 point, and we know that person N's score is determined by others' scores, we can infer that person N's final score is (Total number of games played) minus (Sum of all other players' scores).
    4. Since each game involves two players, the total number of games played equals (N - 1) because we have N players and we're looking at the scores of N-1 players. Therefore, person N's final score is ((N - 1) * (N - 2) / 2) - Sum of all elements in Ai.
    5. Print the calculated score as output.
