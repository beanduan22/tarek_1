Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums of length n and a positive integer k.
The power of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum equal to k.
Return the sum of power of all subsequences of nums.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 
Output:   6 
Explanation:
There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 3: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].

Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:

Input:   nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 
Output:   4 
Explanation:
There are 3 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [2,3,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 5: [2,3,3] and [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].

Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Example 3:

Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 
Output:   0 
Explanation: There exists no subsequence with sum 7. Hence all subsequences of nums have power = 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= 100

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem is a dynamic programming problem that falls under the moderate to hard difficulty level due to its constraints and complexity. It requires proficient skills in dynamic programming and understanding of modular arithmetic for large numbers.

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming with a technique called "dynamic programming on subsets" or "subset sum problem". The main idea is to build an array dp[i][j], where i ranges from 0 to n (number of elements in the input array) and j ranges from 0 to k. For each element nums[i], we have two choices: either include it in our subsequence or exclude it. If we include it, then we add its value to our current sum; if not, then we keep the current sum as it is. The number of ways to achieve a certain sum depends on the previous elements and their respective sums.

The complexity for this problem is O(n*k), where n is the length of the input array and k is the target sum. This is because there are n*k possible combinations to check. However, since we are using dynamic programming, each calculation only depends on previously computed values, which helps us optimize the solution and avoid redundant computations.

Therefore, I would categorize this problem as a moderate to hard level dynamic programming problem that tests skills in array manipulation, modular arithmetic for large numbers, and optimization techniques.
