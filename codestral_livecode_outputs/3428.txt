Problem ID: 3428
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums, where each number in the array appears either once or twice.
Return the bitwise XOR of all the numbers that appear twice in the array, or 0 if no number appears twice.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only number that appears twice in nums is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No number appears twice in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Numbers 1 and 2 appeared twice. 1 XOR 2 == 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50
Each number in nums appears either once or twice.

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the problem statement and examples provided:

- The difficulty level of this problem is Easy to Medium.
- The required programming skills include understanding of bitwise operators, arrays, and frequency counting in general.
- In terms of complexity, we are dealing with a single array iteration (O(n)), where n is the length of the array. After that, another loop might be needed for finding duplicates or their XOR but in the worst case it would still be O(n) because each number appears at most twice.

Therefore, this problem can be categorized as an Array and Bit Manipulation problem with a time complexity of O(n).
