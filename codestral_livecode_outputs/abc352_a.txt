Problem Content:
The AtCoder railway line has N stations, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, N.
On this line, there are inbound trains that start at station 1 and stop at the stations 2, 3, \ldots, N in order, and outbound trains that start at station N and stop at the stations N - 1, N - 2, \ldots, 1 in order.
Takahashi is about to travel from station X to station Y using only one of the inbound and outbound trains.
Determine whether the train stops at station Z during this travel.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N X Y Z

Output

If the train stops at station Z during the travel from station X to station Y, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Constraints


- 3 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq X, Y, Z \leq N
- X, Y, and Z are distinct.
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

7 6 1 3

Sample Output 1

Yes

To travel from station 6 to station 1, Takahashi will take an outbound train.
After departing from station 6, the train stops at stations 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 in order, which include station 3, so you should print Yes.

Sample Input 2

10 3 2 9

Sample Output 2

No

Sample Input 3

100 23 67 45

Sample Output 3

Yes

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a simple algorithmic problem that falls under the category of "if-else" or "conditional statements". The difficulty level can be considered easy because no advanced algorithms or complex data structures are needed to solve it. It requires basic understanding of control flow and logical conditions.

    To solve this, we just need to check if the station Z lies between X and Y when traveling from X to Y on either the inbound or outbound train. This can be done by comparing X, Y, and Z with each other using simple logical expressions.

    The category of this problem is "decision problem" as we are determining whether a certain condition (the train stopping at station Z) holds true or not during a specific situation (Takahashi's travel).
