Problem Content:
For positive integers x and y, define f(x, y) as the remainder of (x + y) divided by 10^8.
You are given a sequence of positive integers A = (A_1, \ldots, A_N) of length N. Find the value of the following expression:
\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\sum_{j=i+1}^N f(A_i,A_j).

- f(A_1,A_2)=50000004 
- f(A_1,A_3)=50000005 
- f(A_2,A_3)=3 

Thus, the answer is f(A_1,A_2) + f(A_1,A_3) + f(A_2,A_3) = 100000012.
Note that you are not asked to compute the remainder of the sum divided by 10^8.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is categorized as a mathematical algorithm problem with a focus on number theory and sequences. It requires a basic understanding of loops, array manipulation, and mathematical operations such as remainder computation.

   Given the constraints (2 ≤ N ≤ 3×10^5), this problem can be solved using efficient algorithms that have a time complexity of O(N log N) or better. Since we are dealing with large numbers up to 10^8, it's crucial to handle possible overflow issues and use optimized solutions.

   Therefore, the difficulty level of this problem can be considered MEDIUM-HARD, as it requires a good understanding of mathematical concepts and efficient programming techniques to solve within the given constraints in an optimal way.
