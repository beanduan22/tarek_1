Problem ID: 3376
Problem Content:
You are given two arrays of strings wordsContainer and wordsQuery.
For each wordsQuery[i], you need to find a string from wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i]. If there are two or more strings in wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in wordsContainer.
Return an array of integers ans, where ans[i] is the index of the string in wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: wordsContainer = ["abcd","bcd","xbcd"], wordsQuery = ["cd","bcd","xyz"]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "cd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "cd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[1] = "bcd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "bcd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[2] = "xyz", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is "", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.


Example 2:

Input: wordsContainer = ["abcdefgh","poiuygh","ghghgh"], wordsQuery = ["gh","acbfgh","acbfegh"]
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "gh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.
For wordsQuery[1] = "acbfgh", only the string at index 0 shares the longest common suffix "fgh". Hence it is the answer, even though the string at index 2 is shorter.
For wordsQuery[2] = "acbfegh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.


 
Constraints:

1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 10^4
1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 10^3
1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 10^3
wordsContainer[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
wordsQuery[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
Sum of wordsContainer[i].length is at most 5 * 10^5.
Sum of wordsQuery[i].length is at most 5 * 10^5.

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a string manipulation problem that can be categorized as medium to hard in terms of difficulty. The problem requires good knowledge of string handling and data structure usage for an efficient solution.

    To solve this problem, we would need:

1. Trie Data Structure: To store the reversed words from wordsContainer. This data structure helps us to find the longest common suffix in a more optimized way.
2. Hash Map/Dictionary: To store the index of each word in wordsContainer and also to track which query is mapped with which container word.
3. Loop Through the Arrays: We would iterate over both arrays wordsContainer and wordsQuery.
4. Find Longest Common Suffix: For each query, we will find a matching container word that has the longest common suffix. If there are multiple matches, we prioritize based on length and position in array.
5. Return Results: After finding all the matching words for queries, we return an array of their indices.

    Time complexity would be O(N*M) where N is the total number of characters in wordsContainer and M is the total number of characters in wordsQuery since we are iterating over each character once. Space complexity would also be O(N+M), considering the space needed for storing all characters in both arrays into Trie data structure.

    In conclusion, this problem can be classified as a trie-based string manipulation problem that requires moderate programming skills to solve efficiently. It falls under medium to hard difficulty category due to its usage of trie data structure and complexities involved in managing different cases to find the correct answer.
