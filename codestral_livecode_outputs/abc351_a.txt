Problem Content:
Team Takahashi and Team Aoki are playing a baseball game, with Team Takahashi batting first.
Currently, the game has finished through the top of the ninth inning, and the bottom of the ninth is about to begin.
Team Takahashi scored A_i runs in the top of the i-th inning (1\leq i\leq 9), and Team Aoki scored B_j runs in the bottom of the j-th inning (1\leq j\leq 8).
At the end of the top of the ninth, Team Takahashi's score is not less than Team Aoki's score.
Determine the minimum number of runs Team Aoki needs to score in the bottom of the ninth to win the game.
Here, if the game is tied at the end of the bottom of the ninth, it results in a draw. Therefore, for Team Aoki to win, they must score strictly more runs than Team Takahashi by the end of the bottom of the ninth.
Team Takahashi's score at any point is the total runs scored in the tops of the innings up to that point, and Team Aoki's score is the total runs scored in the bottoms of the innings.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7 A_8 A_9
B_1 B_2 B_3 B_4 B_5 B_6 B_7 B_8

Output

Print the minimum number of runs Team Aoki needs to score in the bottom of the ninth inning to win.

Constraints


- 0\leq A_i, B_j\leq 99
- A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 + A_5 + A_6 + A_7 + A_8 + A_9 \geq B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4 + B_5 + B_6 + B_7 + B_8
- All input values are integers.

1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0

Sample Output 1

5

At the end of the top of the ninth inning, Team Takahashi has scored seven runs, and Team Aoki has scored three runs.
Therefore, if Team Aoki scores five runs in the bottom of the ninth, the scores will be 7-8, allowing them to win.
Note that scoring four runs would result in a draw and not a victory.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is a simple calculation problem that falls under the category of Beginner level problems in competitive programming. To solve this problem, you need to calculate the total runs scored by Team Takahashi and Team Aoki up until the end of the top of the ninth inning. Then, subtract the total runs of Team Aoki from Team Takahashi's total runs and add one (since it is required for Team Aoki to score strictly more runs than Team Takahashi). If the result is negative or zero, then output 1, otherwise, output the calculated value.

    This problem does not require advanced data structures or algorithms. It mainly tests your ability to read input data and perform arithmetic operations. The complexity of this problem is O(1), meaning it has constant time complexity, as the number of inputs is fixed (9 for Team Takahashi and 8 for Team Aoki).
