Problem ID: 3334
Problem Content:
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.
There are n packs where the i^th pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the i^th box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.
Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.
Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.
 
Example 1:

Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.
It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.

Example 2:

Input: apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We will need to use all the boxes.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == apple.length <= 50
1 <= m == capacity.length <= 50
1 <= apple[i], capacity[i] <= 50
The input is generated such that it's possible to redistribute packs of apples into boxes.

 Category: Medium-Level Problem

    This problem can be classified as a medium-level problem because:

    - The problem involves an optimization issue where we need to find out the minimum number of boxes that can accommodate all the apples from different packs.
    - It requires us to think about efficient use of resources (i.e., box capacities) which can be seen as a common theme in medium-level problems.
    - To solve this, we may need to sort both the apple and capacity arrays and then use a greedy approach that involves selecting boxes with larger capacities first while distributing apples from the packs. This requires understanding of basic sorting algorithms and understanding how to apply greedy strategies in problem-solving.
    - However, note that this problem is less complex than problems which involve dynamic programming or advanced data structures like graphs, trees etc. Therefore, it falls under medium category considering the overall difficulty level of such types of problems.
