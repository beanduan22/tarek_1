Problem ID: 3328
Problem Content:
You are given a positive integer k. Initially, you have an array nums = [1].
You can perform any of the following operations on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any element in the array and increase its value by 1.
Duplicate any element in the array and add it to the end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of elements of the final array greater than or equal to k.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 11
Output: 5
Explanation:
We can do the following operations on the array nums = [1]:

Increase the element by 1 three times. The resulting array is nums = [4].
Duplicate the element two times. The resulting array is nums = [4,4,4].

The sum of the final array is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 which is greater than or equal to k = 11.
The total number of operations performed is 3 + 2 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
The sum of the original array is already greater than or equal to 1, so no operations are needed.

 
Constraints:

1 <= k <= 10^5

 Category: Medium-Hard Dynamic Programming/Greedy

    Explanation: This is a dynamic programming or greedy problem that requires an understanding of optimizing operations to reach a target value. The primary challenge is determining the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a sum greater than or equal to a given positive integer 'k'.

    - Difficulty: Medium-Hard because it's not immediately obvious which approach to take and requires some logical thinking. However, once the right strategy is identified (increase elements as much as possible then duplicate), the problem can be solved relatively easily.

    - Required Programming Skills: Understanding of arrays and basic operations on them, along with a good grasp of loop structures in programming language to perform repetitive tasks. Knowledge of dynamic programming or greedy algorithms might be beneficial but is not strictly required.

    - Complexity: The time complexity for the optimal solution is O(log k) because in each operation we are approximately doubling the size of the sum, and the space complexity is O(1) as we're only using a constant amount of extra variables to keep track of operations and sums.
