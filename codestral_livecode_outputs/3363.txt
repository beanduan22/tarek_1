Problem ID: 3363
Problem Content:
The problem involves tracking the frequency of IDs in a collection that changes over time. You have two integer arrays, nums and freq, of equal length n. Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.

Addition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.
Removal of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.

Return an array ans of length n, where ans[i] represents the count of the most frequent ID in the collection after the i^th step. If the collection is empty at any step, ans[i] should be 0 for that step.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2,1], freq = [3,2,-3,1]
Output: [3,3,2,2]
Explanation:
After step 0, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2. So ans[0] = 3.
After step 1, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[1] = 3.
After step 2, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2.
After step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = 2.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,3], freq = [2,-2,1]
Output: [2,0,1]
Explanation:
After step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.
After step 1, there are no IDs. So ans[1] = 0.
After step 2, we have 1 ID with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length == freq.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
-10^5 <= freq[i] <= 10^5
freq[i] != 0
The input is generated such that the occurrences of an ID will not be negative in any step.

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a "Dynamic Frequency Tracking" problem. It falls under the medium to hard category due to its time complexity requirements and the need for proficient programming skills in data structures and algorithms. The main challenge of this problem is efficiently updating the frequencies of IDs at each step and keeping track of the most frequent ID, which requires using a suitable data structure such as a hashmap or counter along with a priority queue or max heap to maintain the frequency count.

    Here's how we could approach it:
    1. Create an empty hashmap to store frequencies of IDs.
    2. Initialize an empty array to store the answers at each step.
    3. Iterate over the input arrays, nums and freq simultaneously for each index i from 0 to n-1.
       - If freq[i] is positive, add freq[i] occurrences of nums[i] to the hashmap.
       - If freq[i] is negative, remove abs(freq[i]) occurrences of nums[i] from the hashmap.
    4. After each iteration, find the ID with maximum frequency and append it to the answer array.
    5. Return the answer array as the result.

    This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the need for maintaining a priority queue or max heap at each step. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequencies in the hashmap and the answer array.
