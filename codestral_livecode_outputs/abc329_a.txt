Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is a basic string manipulation task that requires separating each character in a given string with a space. This is an introductory level problem that doesn't require advanced programming skills or complex algorithms. It primarily tests the ability to iterate over strings and print characters with a specified format. The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we need to visit each character once.
