Problem Content:
You are given an integer sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_N) of length N and integers L and R such that L\leq R.
For each i=1,2,\ldots,N, find the integer X_i that satisfies both of the following conditions. Note that the integer to be found is always uniquely determined.

- L\leq X_i \leq R.
- For every integer Y such that L \leq Y \leq R, it holds that |X_i - A_i| \leq |Y - A_i|.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N L R
A_1 \ldots A_N

Output

Print X_i for i=1,2,\ldots,N, separated by spaces.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq L\leq R \leq 10^9
- 1\leq A_i\leq 10^9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

5 4 7
3 1 4 9 7

Sample Output 1

4 4 4 7 7

For i=1:

- |4-3|=1
- |5-3|=2
- |6-3|=3
- |7-3|=4

Thus, X_i = 4.

Sample Input 2

3 10 10
11 10 9

Sample Output 2

10 10 10

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem can be categorized as a medium-level algorithmic problem that focuses on array manipulation and conditional logic. The task is to iterate over an integer sequence and for each element, find another integer that satisfies two conditions: it should be within the given range [L, R] and its distance from the current element in the sequence should be less than or equal to any other number's distance in the same range.

The difficulty level of this problem can be considered medium-high as it requires understanding of conditional statements and iterations over sequences, but also involves optimization techniques to solve the problem within given constraints (the maximum size of the sequence is 2Ã—10^5). The complexity is O(N) where N is the length of the sequence, as we need to perform a single pass through the sequence to calculate the required output.

Required programming skills:
- Familiarity with conditional statements and iterations.
- Understanding of basic mathematical operations like absolute difference between numbers.
- Ability to optimize solutions for large input sizes.

Overall, this problem is a good mix of understanding basic programming concepts and applying them efficiently to solve a problem within given constraints.
