Problem ID: abc322_c
Problem Content:
The AtCoder Kingdom holds a festival for N days. On M of these days, namely on the A_1-th, A_2-th, \dots, A_M-th days, fireworks will be launched. It is guaranteed that fireworks will be launched on the last day of the festival. (In other words, A_M=N is guaranteed.)
For each i=1,2,\dots,N, solve the following problem.

- How many days later from the i-th day will fireworks be launched for the first time on or after the i-th day? If fireworks are launched on the i-th day, it is considered to be 0 days later.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N M
A_1 A_2 \dots A_M

Output

Print N lines.
The i-th line (1 \le i \le N) should contain an integer representing the number of days from the i-th day until fireworks are launched for the first time on or after the i-th day.

Constraints


- 1 \le M \le N \le 2 \times 10^5
- 1 \le A_1 < A_2 < \dots < A_M = N
- All input values are integers.

The kingdom holds a festival for 3 days, and fireworks are launched on the 2-nd and 3-rd days.

- From the 1-st day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 2-nd day of the festival, which is 1 day later.
- From the 2-nd day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 2-nd day of the festival, which is 0 days later.
- From the 3-rd day, the first time fireworks are launched is the 3-rd day of the festival, which is 0 days later.

 Problem Category: Algorithms/Data Structures - Array/List Manipulation

    The problem involves manipulating a list of days for which fireworks will be launched during a festival of N days. For each day i (where 1 <= i <= N), the task is to find out how many days later fireworks will be launched for the first time on or after that day. This can be solved by iterating through the list of days with fireworks and comparing them with the current day.

    The difficulty level of this problem would be EASY, as it primarily involves simple array/list manipulation and iteration. Required programming skills include knowledge in handling arrays, lists, or similar data structures, and loops for iterating over those structures.

    The complexity can be determined as follows:
    - Time Complexity: O(N + M) where N is the total number of days and M is the number of days with fireworks. This is because we're iterating through all days once to assign the days when fireworks are launched, and then again to find out how many days later they will be launched for each day.
    - Space Complexity: O(N) as we need to store information about whether or not fireworks will be launched on each day.
