Problem Content:
There are N countries numbered 1 to N. For each i = 1, 2, \ldots, N, Takahashi has A_i units of the currency of country i.
Takahashi can repeat the following operation any number of times, possibly zero:

- First, choose an integer i between 1 and N-1, inclusive.
- Then, if Takahashi has at least S_i units of the currency of country i, he performs the following action once:
- Pay S_i units of the currency of country i and gain T_i units of the currency of country (i+1).



Print the maximum possible number of units of the currency of country N that Takahashi could have in the end.

In the following explanation, let the sequence A = (A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4) represent the numbers of units of the currencies of the countries Takahashi has. Initially, A = (5, 7, 0, 3).
Consider performing the operation four times as follows:

- Choose i = 2, pay four units of the currency of country 2, and gain three units of the currency of country 3. Now, A = (5, 3, 3, 3).
- Choose i = 1, pay two units of the currency of country 1, and gain two units of the currency of country 2. Now, A = (3, 5, 3, 3).
- Choose i = 2, pay four units of the currency of country 2, and gain three units of the currency of country 3. Now, A = (3, 1, 6, 3).
- Choose i = 3, pay five units of the currency of country 3, and gain two units of the currency of country 4. Now, A = (3, 1, 1, 5).

At this point, Takahashi has five units of the currency of country 4, which is the maximum possible number.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about an individual named Takahashi who has a certain amount of currency from N countries. Takahashi can perform an operation any number of times to exchange currency between adjacent countries, but he must pay a specific cost for each exchange. The goal is to determine the maximum possible number of units of the currency of country N that Takahashi could have in the end after performing these exchanges optimally.

This problem can be classified as a dynamic programming problem with a complexity level of DIFFICULT. Dynamic programming involves breaking down a larger problem into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-program only once and storing their results to avoid redundant calculations in the future. In this case, the algorithm would need to keep track of the maximum amount of currency that Takahashi can have for each country at different stages of the exchanges.

Additionally, this problem requires a good understanding of optimization techniques to determine which exchanges are most beneficial, making it a challenging problem that tests programming skills and logical reasoning. The input size is also relatively large, with up to 2 x 10^5 countries, which can lead to time complexity issues if not handled correctly.
