Problem Content:
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.
The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a "Easy" level problem in terms of difficulty. The necessary programming skills include basic understanding of arrays and looping structures. To solve this problem, it requires the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary to count frequencies of numbers in the array.
2. Traverse through the array and for each number increment its frequency in the dictionary.
3. Find the maximum frequency among all frequencies in the dictionary.
4. Count the total number of elements that have this maximum frequency.
5. Return this count as the result.

Overall, the complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we need to traverse through the array once and then traverse the dictionary to find the maximum frequency which has a linear complexity in total.
