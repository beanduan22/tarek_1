Problem Content:
You are given a sequence of positive integers A=(A_1,A_2,\dots,A_N) of length N and a positive integer K.
Find the sum of the integers between 1 and K, inclusive, that do not appear in the sequence A.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
A_1 A_2 \dots A_N

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 2\times 10^5
- 1\leq K \leq 2\times 10^9

1 6 3 1

Sample Output 1

11

Among the integers between 1 and 5, three numbers, 2, 4, and 5, do not appear in A.
Thus, print their sum: 2+4+5=11.

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem is a simple algorithmic problem that can be classified as an implementation or mathematical problem. It involves processing input data (the sequence of positive integers), performing some operations (finding missing numbers in a range), and generating output (the sum of missing numbers). The difficulty level of this problem could be considered EASY to MEDIUM, depending on the constraints.

The problem requires:
1. Understanding of input/output handling from standard inputs or files.
2. Basic programming skills in handling arrays, lists, or sets for storing input data.
3. Ability to iterate through a range and check if elements are present in the given sequence.
4. Mathematical skill to calculate sums within a given range.

The complexity of this problem is O(N), where N is the length of the sequence A, as we may need to iterate through the sequence once to store its values or mark them as present and then iterate again through the range to find missing numbers. However, since K can be up to 2 Ã— 10^9, it's important to note that this solution may not be feasible if N is too large due to memory limitations. In that case, a different approach such as bitwise operations or segment trees might be considered.

In terms of the programming skills required, this problem is mainly testing basic understanding of data structures and algorithms, so it could be solved by beginners with sufficient practice and guidance.
