Problem ID: 3367
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums containing positive integers. We define a function encrypt such that encrypt(x) replaces every digit in x with the largest digit in x. For example, encrypt(523) = 555 and encrypt(213) = 333.
Return the sum of encrypted elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The encrypted elements are [1,2,3]. The sum of encrypted elements is 1 + 2 + 3 == 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,21,31]
Output: 66
Explanation: The encrypted elements are [11,22,33]. The sum of encrypted elements is 11 + 22 + 33 == 66.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem can be analyzed as follows:

1. Difficulty level: Easy to Medium. This is a basic problem that involves iterating over an array and performing some calculations on each element. However, the complexity of calculating the largest digit in a number could add a slight twist to make it more challenging.
2. Required skills: The problem can be solved by having good knowledge of looping constructs, mathematical operations (like finding the max digit), and handling arrays or lists in a programming language. Knowledge of Python, Java, JavaScript, C++ etc will be helpful as these languages are widely used for competitive programming.
3. Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n*m) where n is the length of the array and m is the maximum number of digits in an integer (which can be considered constant - 4, in case of a 4-digit integer). The space complexity is O(1), assuming we don't count the input size towards the space complexity.

Based on this analysis, I would classify this problem as a Basic or Easy level problem. It tests knowledge of looping constructs and mathematical operations which are fundamental skills required for programming.
