Problem ID: 3414
Problem Content:
You are given a non-negative integer k. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the lowest stair numbered 0.
Alice has an integer jump, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach stair k using any number of operations. If she is on stair i, in one operation she can:

Go down to stair i - 1. This operation cannot be used consecutively or on stair 0.
Go up to stair i + 2^jump. And then, jump becomes jump + 1.

Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair k.
Note that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair k, and performs some operations to reach the stair k again.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation:
The 2 possible ways of reaching stair 0 are:

Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.




Example 2:

Input: k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The 4 possible ways of reaching stair 1 are:

Alice starts at stair 1. Alice is at stair 1.
Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^1 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.




 
Constraints:

0 <= k <= 10^9

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem can be classified as a dynamic programming problem with some recursive elements. The difficulty level of this problem is HARD. This problem requires a deep understanding of dynamic programming and bitwise operations to solve it efficiently within the given constraints. The category is also competitive programming.

    The problem involves finding all possible ways for Alice to reach stair k from stair 1, with certain rules for moving up or down stairs. The solution will likely involve creating a recursive function that considers all possible moves from each stair, and keeping track of these possibilities in a dynamic programming table to avoid redundant calculations. Additionally, the problem requires handling large numbers efficiently due to its constraints (k can be as large as 10^9), which may involve using bitwise operations or modular arithmetic.

    A common mistake could be not optimizing the solution with a dynamic programming approach, which would lead to time limit exceeded errors for larger input sizes. Another potential mistake is not handling the constraints properly, which could result in overflow errors or incorrect results due to integer limits.
