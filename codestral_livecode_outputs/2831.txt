Problem ID: 2831
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of indices i, j where 0 <= i < j < nums.length is called beautiful if the first digit of nums[i] and the last digit of nums[j] are coprime.
Return the total number of beautiful pairs in nums.
Two integers x and y are coprime if there is no integer greater than 1 that divides both of them. In other words, x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1, where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.
When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.
Thus, we return 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [11,21,12]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.
Thus, we return 2.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 9999
nums[i] % 10 != 0

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a Medium level problem that can be solved using basic programming skills such as loops and conditional statements. The main concept involved here is that of finding coprime numbers (two numbers having no common factors other than 1). To determine if two numbers are coprime, we use the greatest common divisor (gcd) property where if gcd(x, y) == 1 then x and y are coprime.

    The time complexity of this problem is O(n^2) because for each element in the array, we're checking it against every other element to find beautiful pairs. This is due to the nested loop structure that compares each pair of numbers in the list. However, since n (the size of the input array) can be up to 100 at maximum and this is a small number, the actual runtime will not be heavily impacted by the time complexity.

    This problem could be classified under array or math problems depending on how the problem set is structured. It also falls under computational number theory as it requires understanding of coprime numbers and gcd calculation. However, due to its structure that uses arrays for input data and mathematical concepts, I would place this more under a Math category with emphasis on array manipulation skills.

    To solve this problem:
    1. Define a function to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using Euclidean algorithm.
    2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total number of beautiful pairs and set it to 0.
    3. Loop through each pair of indices in the array. For each pair:
        - Extract the first digit from nums[i] and the last digit from nums[j].
        - Use the gcd function to check if these two digits are coprime. If they are, increment the count of beautiful pairs.
    4. Return the total number of beautiful pairs.
