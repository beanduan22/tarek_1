Problem ID: 3394
Problem Content:
You are given two integers n and x. You have to construct an array of positive integers nums of size n where for every 0 <= i < n - 1, nums[i + 1] is greater than nums[i], and the result of the bitwise AND operation between all elements of nums is x.
Return the minimum possible value of nums[n - 1].
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, x = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
nums can be [4,5,6] and its last element is 6.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, x = 7
Output: 15
Explanation:
nums can be [7,15] and its last element is 15.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, x <= 10^8

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the given problem, it can be analyzed as follows:

The problem falls under the category of Bitwise Operations and Array Manipulation. The difficulty level can be considered MEDIUM to HARD since it requires a good understanding of bitwise operations along with array manipulation techniques.

This is not an entry-level problem as it demands knowledge about bitwise operations, especially the BITWISE AND operation, which can sometimes be tricky for beginners. Also, finding a solution in a single pass and without using extra space will require creative thought and understanding of how numbers are represented in binary format.

The complexity could vary based on the solution approach. A naive or brute force method would have O(n*x) time complexity due to checking each possible element up to n times for x elements. An optimized solution using bitwise operations might have a lower time and space complexity, such as O(1), but it would require a deep understanding of the problem and its underlying principles.
