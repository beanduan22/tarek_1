Problem ID: abc336_b
Problem Content:
For a positive integer X, let \text{ctz}(X) be the (maximal) number of consecutive zeros at the end of the binary notation of X.
If the binary notation of X ends with a 1, then \text{ctz}(X)=0.
You are given a positive integer N. Print \text{ctz}(N).

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print \text{ctz}(N).

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 10^9
- N is an integer.

Sample Input 1

2024

Sample Output 1

3

2024 is 11111101000 in binary, with three consecutive 0s from the end, so \text{ctz}(2024)=3.
Thus, print 3.

Sample Input 2

18

Sample Output 2

1

18 is 10010 in binary, so \text{ctz}(18)=1.
Note that we count the trailing zeros.

Sample Input 3

5

Sample Output 3

0

    Explanation: The problem is about finding the number of consecutive zeros at the end of a positive integer's binary representation. To solve this problem, we need to iteratively divide the number by 2 until we get a remainder that is not zero (which would indicate a 1 in the binary representation). We can keep track of how many times we divided by 2 without getting a remainder to find our answer.

    Complexity: The time complexity for this problem is O(log N) because in each iteration, we're effectively halving the size of the number we're working with until it becomes zero or non-zero. The space complexity is O(1) as we're using a constant amount of space to store our input and output values.

    Solution Steps:
    1. Take the positive integer N as input.
    2. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of consecutive zeros at the end of N's binary representation.
    3. While N is divisible by 2 (i.e., the remainder when divided by 2 is zero), divide N by 2 and increment the counter.
    4. Print the value of the counter as output.
