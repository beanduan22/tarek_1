Problem ID: 3279
Problem Content:
Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a circular field surrounded by flowers. The circle represents the field, and there are x flowers in the clockwise direction between Alice and Bob, and y flowers in the anti-clockwise direction between them.
The game proceeds as follows:

Alice takes the first turn.
In each turn, a player must choose either the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and pick one flower from that side.
At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:

Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
The number of flowers x in the clockwise direction must be in the range [1,n].
The number of flowers y in the anti-clockwise direction must be in the range [1,m].

Return the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, m = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, m = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: No pairs satisfy the conditions described in the statement.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 10^5

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the problem description, it appears to be a problem that can be solved using combinatorial game theory or dynamic programming. The problem involves making decisions under certain constraints (Alice must win the game and the number of flowers in each direction) and optimizing based on those constraints. This type of problem typically requires good understanding of recursion and/or iterative solutions to solve subproblems efficiently.

    Category: Medium-Hard
    Difficulty: It can be considered a medium to hard level problem because it involves strategy optimization, decision making under constraints, and efficient use of resources. Combinatorial game theory or dynamic programming techniques are used in such problems.

    Programming Skills Required: Good understanding of recursion, iterative solutions, and problem-solving strategies involving game theory can be beneficial.

    Complexity: The time complexity can be considered O(n*m) as it might require checking each possible pair (x, y) in the range [1, n] and [1, m]. However, this is an upper bound and the actual complexity may vary depending on the specific solution approach.
