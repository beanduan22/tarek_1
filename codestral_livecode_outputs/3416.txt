Problem ID: 3416
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers where all integers have the same number of digits.
The digit difference between two integers is the count of different digits that are in the same position in the two integers.
Return the sum of the digit differences between all pairs of integers in nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [13,23,12]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We have the following:
- The digit difference between 13 and 23 is 1.
- The digit difference between 13 and 12 is 1.
- The digit difference between 23 and 12 is 2.
So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,10,10,10]
Output: 0
Explanation:
All the integers in the array are the same. So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers will be 0.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] < 10^9
All integers in nums have the same number of digits.

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the provided information, I will analyze the problem and make an educated guess about its category:

1. Difficulty level: The problem appears to be of medium difficulty level because it involves iterating over a list of numbers, comparing each pair of numbers digit by digit, and calculating the sum of differences. No advanced data structures or algorithms are required to solve this problem.
2. Required programming skills: This problem mainly tests basic programming skills such as looping constructs, string manipulation, and mathematical operations. Knowledge of a high-level programming language like Python, Java, C++, or JavaScript is sufficient to solve this problem.
3. Complexity: The time complexity of the solution will be O(n^2 * m) where n is the length of the input list nums and m is the number of digits in each integer. This is because we need to compare each pair of numbers, which requires nested loops, and for each comparison, we need to iterate over all the digits in the numbers. The space complexity will be O(1) because we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the size of the input.

Based on these factors, I would categorize this problem as a medium-level problem that tests basic programming skills and requires understanding of loops and string manipulation to solve efficiently.
