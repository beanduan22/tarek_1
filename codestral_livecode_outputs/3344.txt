Problem ID: 3344
Problem Content:
You are given a array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where points[i] = [x_i, y_i].
The distance between two points is defined as their Manhattan distance.
Return the minimum possible value for maximum distance between any two points by removing exactly one point.
 
Example 1:

Input: points = [[3,10],[5,15],[10,2],[4,4]]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The maximum distance after removing each point is the following:

After removing the 0^th point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
After removing the 1^st point the maximum distance is between points (3, 10) and (10, 2), which is |3 - 10| + |10 - 2| = 15.
After removing the 2^nd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (4, 4), which is |5 - 4| + |15 - 4| = 12.
After removing the 3^rd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.

12 is the minimum possible maximum distance between any two points after removing exactly one point.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Removing any of the points results in the maximum distance between any two points of 0.

 
Constraints:

3 <= points.length <= 10^5
points[i].length == 2
1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a problem from the category of Algorithmic Problems and can be classified as Medium-Hard in terms of difficulty. It requires proficient programming skills and knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and mathematics. The problem can be solved using various techniques, but understanding which one to use efficiently might require a good grasp on algorithm design and analysis.

The problem involves finding the minimum maximum distance between any two points in a 2D plane after removing exactly one point from the given set of points. The solution requires implementing an algorithm that iterates over each point, calculates the Manhattan distance to all other points, removes that point, and then finds the maximum distance among remaining points. This approach, however, has a time complexity of O(n^2) because for every point we are calculating distances with each of the other points which is not suitable when the number of points is large (as given in the constraint).

Thus, to solve this problem efficiently within the given constraints, an algorithm with a lower time complexity needs to be implemented. One such approach could involve finding four corners and using these as potential candidates for removal because they have the highest probability to yield the minimum possible maximum distance after removal.

This problem can be solved in Python or Java or C++. It tests your understanding of array manipulation, mathematical operations, and optimization strategies.
