Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the information provided, this is a Beginner-level programming problem that tests basic string manipulation skills in Python. Here's how to analyze it:

- The problem involves finding the index of the unique character in a given string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- It is stated that all characters but one of S are the same, and the length of S is between 3 and 100.
- To solve this problem, we can iterate through each character in the string and compare it with the first and last characters of the string. If a character doesn't match either of them, then it is the unique character, and we return its index.
- The complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we need to iterate through each character in the string once to find the unique one.

Overall, I would categorize this problem as a Beginner level problem that tests basic string manipulation skills.
