Problem ID: 1899_A
Problem Content:
Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer $n$. On their turn, the player can add $1$ to the current integer or subtract $1$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by $3$, then he wins. If $10$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer $n$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.

The single line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$).

Output

For each test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.Sample Input 1:

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about a game played by two players, Vanya and Vova. They are given an integer n, and they take turns adding or subtracting 1 from the current integer. If the integer becomes divisible by 3 after Vanya's move, he wins; otherwise, Vova wins if 10 moves have passed without Vanya winning. The task is to determine who will win if both players play optimally, given the integer n as input.

    This problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem with a game theory element. The difficulty level is moderate to hard because it requires understanding of game theory principles and dynamic programming techniques to solve optimally. The required programming skills include knowledge of recursion, memoization, and basic game theory concepts such as minimax algorithm. The complexity of the problem can be considered as moderately complex due to the need for analyzing different states of the game and making optimal decisions based on those states.
