Problem Content:
Takahashi tried to type a string S consisting of lowercase English letters using a keyboard.
He was typing while looking only at the keyboard, not the screen.
Whenever he mistakenly typed a different lowercase English letter, he immediately pressed the backspace key. However, the backspace key was broken, so the mistakenly typed letter was not deleted, and the actual string typed was T.
He did not mistakenly press any keys other than those for lowercase English letters.
The characters in T that were not mistakenly typed are called correctly typed characters.
Determine the positions in T of the correctly typed characters.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S
T

Output

Let |S| be the length of S. If the correctly typed characters are the A_1-th, A_2-th, \ldots, A_{|S|}-th characters of T, print the values of A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_{|S|} in this order, separated by spaces.
Ensure that the output is in ascending order. That is, A_i < A_{i + 1} should hold for each 1 \leq i \leq |S| - 1.

Constraints


- S and T are strings of lowercase English letters with lengths between 1 and 2 \times 10^5, inclusive.
- T is a string obtained by the procedure described in the problem statement.

Sample Input 1

abc
axbxyc

Sample Output 1

1 3 6

The sequence of Takahashi's typing is as follows:

- Type a.
- Try to type b but mistakenly type x.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Type b.
- Try to type c but mistakenly type x.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Try to type c but mistakenly type y.
- Press the backspace key, but the character is not deleted.
- Type c.

The correctly typed characters are the first, third, and sixth characters.

Sample Input 2

aaaa
bbbbaaaa

Sample Output 2

5 6 7 8

Sample Input 3

atcoder
atcoder

Sample Output 3

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Takahashi did not mistakenly type any characters.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem can be categorized as a string manipulation problem with moderate difficulty. It requires comparing two strings, 'S' and 'T', where 'T' contains extra characters that were mistakenly typed by Takahashi. The task is to determine the positions in 'T' of the correctly typed characters from 'S'. This can be achieved using two pointers to iterate through both strings simultaneously, which is a common approach for this kind of problem.

The required programming skills include basic string manipulation and understanding of loops. Since the problem involves comparing and manipulating two strings, its complexity is linear in the size of the input strings. Thus, it can be efficiently solved with time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string 'T'. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the output array that stores the positions of correctly typed characters.

Overall, this problem can be considered a moderate-level programming problem that tests basic string manipulation skills and understanding of loops.
