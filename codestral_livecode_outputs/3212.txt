Problem ID: 3212
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
A partition of an array into one or more contiguous subarrays is called good if no two subarrays contain the same number.
Return the total number of good partitions of nums.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 possible good partitions are: ([1], [2], [3], [4]), ([1], [2], [3,4]), ([1], [2,3], [4]), ([1], [2,3,4]), ([1,2], [3], [4]), ([1,2], [3,4]), ([1,2,3], [4]), and ([1,2,3,4]).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible good partition is: ([1,1,1,1]).

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 possible good partitions are: ([1,2,1], [3]) and ([1,2,1,3]).

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem is a dynamic programming or sliding window type of question and it can be considered as a medium to hard level question. Here's why:

- Difficulty: The problem requires understanding of partitioning algorithms and optimizing solutions using dynamic programming techniques. It also involves handling large input data which makes the problem moderately difficult.

- Required Skills: To solve this problem, one needs a good understanding of arrays in programming, specifically 0-indexed arrays. Additionally, knowledge of dynamic programming or sliding window techniques is beneficial as these concepts are often used to optimize solutions for partitioning problems. Finally, an understanding of modulo operations and how they can be used to manage large output values is necessary.

- Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we need to iterate through each element in the array once. However, the space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of additional data structures such as a dictionary or hash map to keep track of the last occurrence of each number in the array.
