Problem ID: 3411
Problem Content:
A powerful array for an integer x is the shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to x. For example, the powerful array for 11 is [1, 2, 8].
The array big_nums is created by concatenating the powerful arrays for every positive integer i in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, and so forth. Thus, big_nums starts as [1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...].
You are given a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [from_i, to_i, mod_i] you should calculate (big_nums[from_i] * big_nums[from_i + 1] * ... * big_nums[to_i]) % mod_i.
Return an integer array answer such that answer[i] is the answer to the i^th query.
 
Example 1:

Input: queries = [[1,3,7]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
There is one query.
big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. The product of them is 4. The remainder of 4 under 7 is 4.

Example 2:

Input: queries = [[2,5,3],[7,7,4]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
There are two queries.
First query: big_nums[2..5] = [1,2,4,1]. The product of them is 8. The remainder of 8 under 3 is 2.
Second query: big_nums[7] = 2. The remainder of 2 under 4 is 2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 500
queries[i].length == 3
0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= 10^15
1 <= queries[i][2] <= 10^5

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a mathematical algorithm problem, specifically involving number theory and modular arithmetic. It requires good knowledge of how to manipulate large numbers efficiently in a programming context. The difficulty level is hard due to the constraints provided and the optimization requirements. A brute force approach would not work because of the size limitation of the input (10^15). Therefore, this problem requires an algorithmic approach that can solve it in a more efficient manner.

    Here's a brief analysis of the problem:

    1. To solve this problem, we first need to understand how to find the powerful array for any number x and concatenate these arrays to form big_nums. This would require an efficient method to find the powers of 2 that sum up to a given number as well as a method to concatenate these arrays.
    2. After generating or retrieving elements from big_nums, we need to calculate the product of all numbers in the range [from_i, to_i] and then take modulo mod_i of this product. This requires understanding of how to handle large numbers effectively in programming context.
    3. Finally, we repeat the above steps for each query in the queries array.

    Given these points, this problem can be solved by applying advanced number theory concepts along with optimization techniques to handle large numbers and calculations efficiently in a programming environment.
