Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums. We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].
base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].
Return true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.
Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 3]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 4:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= num[i] <= 200

Codestral Analysis:
 Based on the provided problem, it can be categorized as a simple array or hash map problem. This problem is considered easy to medium in difficulty level. No advanced data structures or algorithms are needed to solve this problem. Basic understanding of arrays or hash maps should suffice to create a solution.

    The main focus of this problem is to check if the given array is a permutation of an array base[n], where n is the maximum element in the array nums and base[n] is defined as [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n]. If it's true, we return true; otherwise, we return false.

    To solve this problem:
    1. First, find the maximum element in nums which will be our candidate for n.
    2. Create a frequency map or an array to keep track of the occurrence of each number in nums.
    3. Iterate through nums and update the frequency map.
    4. If any number in nums is greater than n or less than 1, return false.
    5. If the count of n in nums is not exactly two, return false.
    6. Finally, check that all other numbers from 1 to n-1 occur exactly once in nums. If they do, return true; otherwise, return false.

    This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array nums.
