Problem ID: abc324_a
Problem Content:
You are given N integers A _ 1,A _ 2,\ldots,A _ N.
If their values are all equal, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A _ 1 A _ 2 \ldots A _ N

Output

Print a single line containing Yes if the values of the given A _ 1,A _ 2,\ldots,A _ N are all equal, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 2\leq N\leq100
- 1\leq A _ i\leq100\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
3 2 4

Sample Output 1

No

We have A _ 1\neq A _ 2, so you should print No.

Sample Input 2

4
3 3 3 3

Sample Output 2

Yes

We have A _ 1=A _ 2=A _ 3=A _ 4, so you should print Yes.

Sample Input 3

10
73 8 55 26 97 48 37 47 35 55

Sample Output 3

No

    Difficulty: Easy

    This problem checks basic understanding of handling input/output in a program and simple string manipulation. Given N integers as input, the task is to check if all the numbers are equal or not. If they are all equal, print 'Yes', otherwise print 'No'. The difficulty level can be categorized as easy because it only requires basic I/O operations and comparison of strings, which are fundamental programming concepts.

    In terms of programming skills required, understanding how to take input in a loop, store the input values and compare them should suffice. This does not involve complex data structures or algorithms. As for complexity, the time complexity is O(N) as we need to iterate through all N numbers once. The space complexity is also O(N) because we are storing all the N numbers in memory.
