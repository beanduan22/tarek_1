Problem ID: 3383
Problem Content:
In a mystic dungeon, n magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.
You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician i, you will be instantly transported to magician (i + k). This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where (i + k) does not exist.
In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with k jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, absorbing all the energy during the journey.
You are given an array energy and an integer k. Return the maximum possible energy you can gain.
 
Example 1:

Input:  energy = [5,2,-10,-5,1], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We can gain a total energy of 3 by starting from magician 1 absorbing 2 + 1 = 3.

Example 2:

Input: energy = [-2,-3,-1], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: We can gain a total energy of -1 by starting from magician 2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= energy.length <= 10^5
-1000 <= energy[i] <= 1000
1 <= k <= energy.length - 1

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem with some elements of array manipulation and maximum subarray sum algorithms. It falls under the intermediate to hard level in terms of difficulty since it requires understanding of dynamic programming concepts and efficient computation techniques to optimize the solution for large input sizes. This problem would also test the ability to think abstractly and apply mathematical logic within a programming context, as well as the efficiency to handle loops and conditionals correctly. The complexity lies in finding an optimal strategy to gain maximum energy while traversing the array with jumps of size k.
