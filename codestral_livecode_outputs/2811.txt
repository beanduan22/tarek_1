Problem ID: 2811
Problem Content:
You are given two integers, n and k.
An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, k = 4
Output: 18
Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, k = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, k <= 50

Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a problem of number theory and mathematical reasoning with a moderate level of difficulty. To solve this problem, you need to have strong understanding of mathematical principles and algorithms to optimize computations.

   The approach for solving the problem would involve a few key steps:
   1) Understand that to minimize the sum, we should include small positive integers in the array.
   2) Since the pairwise sums cannot be equal to 'k', if one number is included, then its complement (i.e., k - this number) should not be included in the array.
   3) Build the array by including consecutive numbers starting from 1 until we reach the length 'n' or encounter a number that would make the pairwise sum equal to 'k'.
   4) If there are still elements remaining to fill, start including the next eligible numbers after 'k' has been crossed.

   The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as we perform a single pass through the range of possible array values. The space complexity is also O(n), as we store the resulting array.

   This problem does not require complex data structures or advanced algorithms, but it tests problem-solving skills and understanding of basic number theory concepts.
