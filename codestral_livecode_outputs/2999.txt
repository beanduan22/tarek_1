Problem ID: 2999
Problem Content:
You are given two strings s1 and s2, both of length 4, consisting of lowercase English letters.
You can apply the following operation on any of the two strings any number of times:

Choose any two indices i and j such that j - i = 2, then swap the two characters at those indices in the string.

Return true if you can make the strings s1 and s2 equal, and false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "cdab"
Output: true
Explanation: We can do the following operations on s1:
- Choose the indices i = 0, j = 2. The resulting string is s1 = "cbad".
- Choose the indices i = 1, j = 3. The resulting string is s1 = "cdab" = s2.

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dacb"
Output: false
Explanation: It is not possible to make the two strings equal.

 
Constraints:

s1.length == s2.length == 4
s1 and s2 consist only of lowercase English letters.

Codestral Analysis:
 This is a type of string manipulation problem with an added twist of swapping characters. The problem seems relatively straightforward because the strings are limited to length 4, and the swap operation can be applied any number of times to one or both strings. However, it might still require some thought and approach to determine if two specific strings can be made equal using only valid swaps (characters at a distance of 2).

    Based on these observations, I would consider this problem as a moderate difficulty level. It's not a complex algorithmic problem that requires advanced data structures or algorithms; rather, it's about manipulating and comparing strings efficiently. Given the constraints provided in the problem (strings of length 4 and limited character set), the solution may not involve heavy computational tasks, making this problem suitable for beginners to intermediate level programmers.

    In terms of programming skills, this problem might require knowledge of string manipulation, looping constructs, comparison operators, and maybe a bit of thinking about possible swap operations. The complexity of the problem is linear O(n), where n is the length of the strings (which in this case is 4).

    Overall, I'd classify this as an easy to moderate-level string manipulation problem that tests the ability to think logically and write clear code within given constraints.
