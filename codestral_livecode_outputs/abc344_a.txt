Codestral Analysis:
 This problem can be categorized as a basic string manipulation problem in programming. The difficulty level of this problem is considered easy because it only requires finding two specific characters within a string and removing everything between them. This doesn't involve any complex data structures or algorithms. The required programming skills for solving this problem include understanding how to iterate over strings, handle input/output operations, and perform basic string manipulation functions like finding the index of a character and slicing a string.

    As for the complexity, since we only have to scan through the string once and find two specific characters, the time complexity is linear, O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is also linear, O(n), as we might need additional space proportional to the size of the input to store the modified string.
