Problem ID: 3361
Problem Content:
You are given a string s representing a 12-hour format time where some of the digits (possibly none) are replaced with a "?".
12-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 11, and MM is between 00 and 59. The earliest 12-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 11:59.
You have to replace all the "?" characters in s with digits such that the time we obtain by the resulting string is a valid 12-hour format time and is the latest possible.
Return the resulting string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "1?:?4"
Output: "11:54"
Explanation: The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing "?" characters is "11:54".

Example 2:

Input: s = "0?:5?"
Output: "09:59"
Explanation: The latest 12-hour format time we can achieve by replacing "?" characters is "09:59".

 
Constraints:

s.length == 5
s[2] is equal to the character ":".
All characters except s[2] are digits or "?" characters.
The input is generated such that there is at least one time between "00:00" and "11:59" that you can obtain after replacing the "?" characters.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem can be categorized as a string manipulation problem with certain constraints. It falls under the Easy level of difficulty. To solve this problem, we need to have good knowledge of handling strings and their operations in Python or any other programming language.

    The algorithm will involve replacing "?" characters in the given time string from the rightmost character to the leftmost one. For each "?", if it's in the hours section (the first two characters) we will replace it with '1' if possible, otherwise we will replace it with '0'. If it's in the minutes section (the last two characters), we will always replace it with '5', since that's the maximum value allowed for minutes.

    The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string, because we need to iterate over each character once. This algorithm has a space complexity of O(1) as we are not using any additional data structure whose size grows with the input size.
