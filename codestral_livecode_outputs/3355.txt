Problem ID: 3355
Problem Content:
You are given a binary array possible of length n.
Alice and Bob are playing a game that consists of n levels. Some of the levels in the game are impossible to clear while others can always be cleared. In particular, if possible[i] == 0, then the i^th level is impossible to clear for both the players. A player gains 1 point on clearing a level and loses 1 point if the player fails to clear it.
At the start of the game, Alice will play some levels in the given order starting from the 0^th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.
Alice wants to know the minimum number of levels she should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to maximize their points.
Return the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points. If this is not possible, return -1.
Note that each player must play at least 1 level.
 
Example 1:

Input: possible = [1,0,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 point.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 = 0 points, while Bob has 1 - 1 = 0 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 point, while Bob has -1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 1 level to gain more points.

Example 2:

Input: possible = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has 4 points.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 2 points, while Bob has 3 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 3 points, while Bob has 2 points.
If Alice plays till level 3 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 4 points, while Bob has 1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 3 levels to gain more points.

Example 3:

Input: possible = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation:
The only possible way is for both players to play 1 level each. Alice plays level 0 and loses 1 point. Bob plays level 1 and loses 1 point. As both players have equal points, Alice can't gain more points than Bob.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n == possible.length <= 10^5
possible[i] is either 0 or 1.

Codestral Analysis:
 The given problem can be categorized as a dynamic programming problem that involves optimizing the strategies of two players in a game. Here's an analysis:

Difficulty: Medium-Hard. This is not a beginner-level problem because it requires understanding of dynamic programming and game theory concepts to solve.

Required Programming Skills: Knowledge of arrays, loops, and dynamic programming techniques are necessary to solve this problem. A good grasp on how to design and implement algorithms that involve optimizing strategies for two players in a game is also beneficial.

Complexity: The time complexity of the solution will be O(n), where n is the length of the binary array 'possible'. This is because we need to iterate through each element of the array once to calculate the result. The space complexity will also be O(n) as we are using a dynamic programming approach and storing the intermediate results in an array.

Based on these factors, I would categorize this problem as a medium-hard level dynamic programming problem that requires understanding of game theory concepts to solve optimally.
