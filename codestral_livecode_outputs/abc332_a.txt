Problem ID: abc332_a
Problem Content:
AtCoder Inc. sells merchandise through its online shop.
Takahashi has decided to purchase N types of products from there.
For each integer i from 1 to N, the i-th type of product has a price of P_i yen each, and he will buy Q_i of this.
Additionally, he must pay a shipping fee.
The shipping fee is 0 yen if the total price of the products purchased is S yen or above, and K yen otherwise.
He will pay the total price of the products purchased plus the shipping fee.
Calculate the amount he will pay.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N S K
P_1 Q_1
P_2 Q_2
\vdots
P_N Q_N

Output

Print the amount Takahashi will pay for online shopping.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq 100
- 1\leq S\leq 10000
- 1\leq K\leq 10000
- 1\leq P_i\leq 10000
- 1\leq Q_i\leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 2000 500
1000 1
100 6

Sample Output 1

2100

Takahashi buys one product for 1000 yen and six products for 100 yen each.
Thus, the total price of the products is 1000\times 1+100\times 6=1600 yen.
Since the total amount for the products is less than 2000 yen, the shipping fee will be 500 yen.
Therefore, the amount Takahashi will pay is 1600+500=2100 yen.

Sample Input 2

3 2000 500
1000 1
100 6
5000 1

Sample Output 2

6600

The total price of the products is 1000\times 1+100\times 6+5000\times 1=6600 yen.
Since the total amount for the products is not less than 2000 yen, the shipping fee will be 0 yen.
Therefore, the amount Takahashi will pay is 6600+0=6600 yen.

Sample Input 3

2 2000 500
1000 1
1000 1

Sample Output 3

2000

There may be multiple products with the same price per item.

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about calculating the total cost of purchasing N types of merchandise from an online shop for Takahashi, considering the individual prices and quantities, and a shipping fee that depends on the total price of products purchased. This problem can be classified as a basic programming problem with elements of input/output operations and mathematical calculations.

Difficulty: Easy
Required Programming Skills: Basic knowledge of input/output operations and mathematical calculations (addition, multiplication, conditional statements) in any programming language.
Complexity: The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of types of products. This is because we need to iterate through each type of product once to calculate its total price and add it to the overall total. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the total cost, shipping fee, and other variables.
