Problem ID: 3375
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer k.
You have an infinite number of coins of each denomination. However, you are not allowed to combine coins of different denominations.
Return the k^th smallest amount that can be made using these coins.
 
Example 1:

Input: coins = [3,6,9], k = 3
Output:  9
Explanation: The given coins can make the following amounts:
Coin 3 produces multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.
Coin 6 produces multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.
Coin 9 produces multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, etc.
All of the coins combined produce: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.

Example 2:

Input: coins = [5,2], k = 7
Output: 12 
Explanation: The given coins can make the following amounts:
Coin 5 produces multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc.
Coin 2 produces multiples of 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, etc.
All of the coins combined produce: 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 15, etc.

 
Constraints:

1 <= coins.length <= 15
1 <= coins[i] <= 25
1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9
coins contains pairwise distinct integers.

Codestral Analysis:
 Category: Medium-Hard
     Explanation: This is a medium to hard level problem because it requires understanding of basic number theory concepts as well as advanced data structures such as binary heaps or priority queues for efficient solving. The problem can be solved using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach where we maintain a min heap of the smallest possible amounts that can be made so far, and use a set to keep track of which amounts have been seen before. This ensures that we don't revisit any amount multiple times, and allows us to find the k^th smallest amount in O(k log m) time, where m is the maximum value that can be made using the coins (which is at most 25 * k). The problem can also be solved using a dynamic programming approach, but this would require additional space.
