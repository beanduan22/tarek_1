Problem ID: 3236
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums.
A prefix nums[0..i] is sequential if, for all 1 <= j <= i, nums[j] = nums[j - 1] + 1. In particular, the prefix consisting only of nums[0] is sequential.
Return the smallest integer x missing from nums such that x is greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The longest sequential prefix of nums is [1,2,3] with a sum of 6. 6 is not in the array, therefore 6 is the smallest missing integer greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,12,14,13]
Output: 15
Explanation: The longest sequential prefix of nums is [3,4,5] with a sum of 12. 12, 13, and 14 belong to the array while 15 does not. Therefore 15 is the smallest missing integer greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is about finding the smallest missing integer in a given array of integers that is greater than or equal to the sum of the longest sequential prefix of the array. To solve this problem, we can sort the array first and then iterate through it while keeping track of the current sequence length and expected next number. Once we find a break in the sequence or reach the end of the array, we can calculate and return the missing integer as described in the problem statement.

This problem is categorized as an "Easy" level problem because:

1. Difficulty: The difficulty of this problem is low to moderate. It primarily tests understanding of basic looping constructs, sorting algorithms (although in-place sorting could be used), and the ability to think logically about sequences.
2. Required Programming Skills: This problem requires knowledge of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and a basic understanding of sequence patterns. It does not require any advanced data structures or algorithms.
3. Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. However, it can be optimized to O(n) by using an in-place sorting algorithm and then iterating through the array once more to find the missing integer. This optimization is not necessary for solving the problem within reasonable time constraints (given that n <= 50), but it's a good practice for large input sizes. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of additional space to store variables like sum and expected next number.
