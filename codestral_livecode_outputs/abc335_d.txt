Problem Content:
There is a grid with N rows and N columns, where N is an odd number at most 45.
Let (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
In this grid, you will place Takahashi and a dragon consisting of N^2-1 parts numbered 1 to N^2-1 in such a way that satisfies the following conditions:

- Takahashi must be placed at the center of the grid, that is, in cell (\frac{N+1}{2},\frac{N+1}{2}).
- Except for the cell where Takahashi is, exactly one dragon part must be placed in each cell.
- For every integer x satisfying 2 \leq x \leq N^2-1, the dragon part x must be placed in a cell adjacent by an edge to the cell containing part x-1.
- Cells (i,j) and (k,l) are said to be adjacent by an edge if and only if |i-k|+|j-l|=1.



Print one way to arrange the parts to satisfy the conditions. It is guaranteed that there is at least one arrangement that satisfies the conditions.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print N lines.
The i-th line should contain X_{i,1},\ldots,X_{i,N} separated by spaces, where X_{i,j} is T when placing Takahashi in cell (i,j) and x when placing part x there.

Constraints


- 3 \leq N \leq 45

Codestral Analysis:
 The problem is a grid placement problem where you need to arrange Takahashi and N^2-1 dragon parts in an NxN grid such that certain conditions are met. The grid has an odd size N (at most 45). Takahashi must be placed at the center of the grid, and each cell (except for Takahashi's cell) should contain exactly one dragon part. Each dragon part number x+1 must be placed in a cell adjacent by an edge to the cell containing part x.

Category Analysis:
- Difficulty Level: Medium
- Required Skills: Basic Programming, Algorithm Development, Grid Manipulation, Loop Constructs
- Complexity: The time complexity is O(N^2) as we are iterating through each cell of the grid once. The space complexity is also O(N^2) as we need to store the arrangement in a 2D array.

This problem can be solved by using a spiral approach to fill the grid with dragon parts while making sure that each part is placed adjacent to the previous one and Takahashi is at the center. To implement this, we can use four variables to keep track of our current position (row and column) and the direction we are moving in. We then iterate through the dragon parts and place them accordingly while updating our current position and direction based on whether we have reached the edge of the grid or not.

This problem is a good exercise for practicing algorithm development, grid manipulation, loop constructs, and understanding the logic behind arranging elements in a spiral pattern.
