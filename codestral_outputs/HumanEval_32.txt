 Category: Intermediate to Advanced

   The problem is about finding a zero point of a polynomial function given by a list of coefficients. A crucial detail in this problem is that it only considers polynomials with an even number of coefficients. This makes the problem more complex as we need to handle quadratic and higher degree polynomials, which often don't have closed-form solutions.

   In addition, the function `find_zero` is expected to find and return only one zero point, even if there are multiple. This suggests that we might need to implement some kind of root finding algorithm or approximation method to solve this problem accurately.

   The difficulty level of the problem can be considered intermediate to advanced, mainly due to its mathematical complexity and the potential need for implementing numerical methods in Python code. Knowledge of Python programming, specifically functions, lists, enumeration, mathematical operations, and potentially root finding algorithms is required to solve this problem.
