 The problem is a function implementation problem that falls into the category of "Easy" to "Medium". It requires the understanding of loops, conditionals, modulo operation, and string manipulation in Python. The task is to write a program that iterates over numbers less than 'n', checks if they are divisible by 11 or 13, and then counts the number of times the digit '7' appears in these numbers. This problem tests basic looping constructs and conditional statements along with string manipulation skills to solve a moderately complex problem. The time complexity is O(n) as we need to iterate over all numbers less than 'n'.
