 This problem can be categorized as an Easy level problem in programming.

   Difficulty: The problem seems simple because it only involves checking if a string's length is at least 3 and then iterating through the string to check every consecutive group of three characters for distinctiveness. Thus, the difficulty level is Easy.

   Programming Skills Required: To solve this problem, basic knowledge in Python programming language is required since the problem is presented in a Python function format. Additionally, understanding of string manipulation and looping structures can be beneficial. No advanced programming skills are required for this problem.

   Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we need to iterate through each character in the string once. Therefore, the problem's complexity can be considered low or linear, making it a relatively simple and efficient algorithm to implement.

   In conclusion, based on the analysis, this problem falls under the category of Easy level problems. It requires basic Python programming skills and has a linear time complexity, which makes it a good problem for beginners to practice looping structures and string manipulation in Python.
