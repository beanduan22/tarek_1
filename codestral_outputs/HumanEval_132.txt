 The problem can be categorized as an "Easy" level problem. It requires understanding of basic string manipulation and usage of data structures such as stack. The difficulty lies in identifying the pattern of nested brackets rather than complex algorithms or advanced data structures. It is more about parsing a given string to check for valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket is nested. This problem can be solved using programming languages that have good support for string manipulation and stack data structure such as Python, Java, C++ etc. However, the complexity of this algorithm is linear, O(n), since we are traversing through each character in the input string exactly once.
