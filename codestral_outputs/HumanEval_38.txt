   Difficulty: The problem is relatively straightforward if you understand how to handle strings in Python and basic list manipulation. It might be considered easier if you're already familiar with these concepts.

   Required Programming Skills: Basic knowledge of Python, particularly string manipulation and list comprehensions. Understanding of slicing in Python would also be beneficial for solving this problem effectively.

   Complexity: The complexity is linear as we are iterating through the input string only once during both encoding and decoding operations. Hence, time complexity can be considered to be O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
