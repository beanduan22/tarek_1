 Based on the provided information, I'd categorize this problem as a "Beginner - Intermediate" level problem in the field of Programming. Here's why:

1. Difficulty Level: The problem statement is clear and provides examples which makes it easier to understand. Also, the required functionality isn't too complex. However, since we are dealing with hexadecimal numbers, some basic understanding of number systems would be helpful. Therefore, I'd classify this as a Beginner - Intermediate level problem.

2. Required Programming Skills: This problem requires knowledge about handling strings and loops in the programming language used. Also, checking for prime numbers might require an understanding of basic mathematical concepts. Therefore, it would be suitable for beginners who have some prior exposure to programming and intermediate programmers who may need a quick revision on these topics.

3. Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because in the worst case we might need to loop through each character in the string once. The space complexity is O(1) as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the size of the input. So, from a computational complexity standpoint, this problem isn't too complex.
