    Explanation: This problem tests your understanding of string manipulation, data structures (dictionaries), and data analysis. It requires iterating over a string, updating values in a dictionary, and finding maximum values in it. Although these tasks are not complex on their own, implementing them all correctly in one function can be challenging for beginners.

    Skills required: Proficiency in programming language (Python), understanding of data structures (dictionaries), basic string manipulation skills, ability to analyze and solve problems logically, and familiarity with the problem domain.
