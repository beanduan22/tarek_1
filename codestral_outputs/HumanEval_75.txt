 The problem can be categorized as "Medium" in terms of difficulty. It requires knowledge of basic number theory concepts like prime numbers and their multiplication properties. Additionally, the function implementation will involve iterating through a set of numbers up to 100 and checking for divisibility, which is a common task in programming problems related to number theory.

   The problem falls under the category "Mathematical Algorithms" as it mainly involves mathematical logic and operations to find if a given number can be expressed as the product of three prime numbers. This category also includes other mathematical problems like finding the greatest common divisor, checking for perfect numbers, or detecting patterns in sequences.

   In terms of complexity, the function has a time complexity of O(n^3) because we might need to check for each number if it is prime (which takes O(n)), and then check all combinations of three numbers that multiply to the given input number (which results in O(n^3)). However, since the maximum value of 'a' is 100, this time complexity won't be an issue for practical applications.
