 This problem can be categorized as an "Easy" level problem under the "Array & List Manipulation" and "Conditional Statements" categories. The main challenge of this problem is not its complexity but rather understanding what specific conditions need to be met for a number to be counted - numbers must be greater than 10 and have odd first and last digits. This requires using conditional statements to check each element in the list against these criteria, which could involve casting numbers to strings and checking their characters.

   In terms of programming skills required, knowledge about arrays (lists in Python), loops for iterating over elements, if-else or similar conditional statements, and basic string manipulation should be enough to solve this problem. It doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms knowledge unless the problem is scaled up significantly with more complex conditions.

   Overall, while there could be some slight variation in difficulty depending on a person's prior experience, this problem can generally be considered an introductory level problem that tests basic understanding of array manipulation and conditional statements.
