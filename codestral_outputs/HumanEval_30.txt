 The problem category for this task would be "Easy to Medium".

   This is a basic filtering problem where you need to iterate over a list of numbers and only keep those that are positive. This does not require advanced data structures or algorithms; simple looping and conditional checking should suffice. However, the exact difficulty can vary based on a person's familiarity with Python syntax. If someone is new to programming, they might find it more challenging due to unfamiliarity with list operations in Python.

   The required programming skills for this task include:
   - Familiarity with Python syntax and data structures (especially lists).
   - Basic understanding of looping constructs (for/while loops) and conditional statements (if).

   In terms of complexity, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because we need to check each element once to determine if it's positive or not. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario (all numbers are positive), we would need to create a new list with all the elements from the input list. However, in practice, the space complexity could be less than O(n) because we're not creating copies of each element; we're just keeping references to them if they're positive.
