 The problem can be classified as a beginner-level question because it tests basic understanding of Python lists and sorting.

   Category: Beginner-Level Question

   Explanation: This problem requires writing a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the second smallest element in the list. The solution involves removing any duplicates, sorting the remaining elements, and then checking if there is a second element in the sorted list or not. These operations are all common and basic tasks when working with lists in Python, making this an appropriate problem for beginners to solve.

   Difficulty: Easy

   Skills Required: Basic knowledge of Python lists, removing duplicates from a list, sorting elements in a list, understanding of Python's None keyword, and writing simple functions.

   Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where 'n' is the number of elements in the input list. The space complexity is O(n) because we are storing the unique elements of the list. However, these complexities should not pose a significant challenge for beginners.
