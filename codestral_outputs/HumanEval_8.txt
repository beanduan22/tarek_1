 The problem is categorized as a "Basic" level problem in terms of difficulty. It requires basic knowledge of Python, understanding of list iteration, and simple arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication. Given that the input can be an empty list, it also involves some conditional statements to handle edge cases. However, since the size of the list is not mentioned in the problem statement, we should assume that the input could potentially contain a large number of elements, which might impact performance with very large inputs. Hence, the complexity is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the list.
