 Based on the problem description provided, this task can be categorized as a basic-level programming problem. The problem involves iterating through a list of numbers, performing an operation (rounding to the upper integer and squaring) on each number, and then summing these results. This does not require advanced programming skills or complex algorithms. Therefore, I would consider this task a "Beginner" level problem in Python.
