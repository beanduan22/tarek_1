 This is a medium-level problem that falls into the category of string manipulation algorithms. It requires the ability to identify palindromes and the use of slicing operations to find prefixes and postfixes in strings.

Difficulty: Medium

Required Programming Skills:
1. String Manipulation: The problem involves understanding how to manipulate strings such as reversing them, finding substrings, and concatenating them.
2. Recursion (Optional): Although not explicitly stated in the problem, a possible solution may involve recursive calls. However, this is an optional aspect of the problem.
3. Loops: Understanding loop structures like while or for loops to iterate through string characters can be beneficial.
4. Conditional Statements: The problem might require using if-else statements to handle base cases and other conditions.
5. Time Complexity Analysis (Optional): While not explicitly asked, understanding the time complexity of solutions is a good skill to have. In this case, a solution with lower time complexity would be more efficient.

Complexity:
1. Time Complexity: The main operation in this problem is string concatenation and reversing which takes O(n) time where n is the length of the input string. Therefore, the overall time complexity is likely to be linear. However, if a recursive approach is chosen, the time complexity could be higher due to repeated substring operations.
2. Space Complexity: The space complexity is also likely to be linear because we are creating new strings for storing palindromes and reversed prefixes.
