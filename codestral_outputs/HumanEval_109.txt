 This problem can be classified as a moderate-level problem in the area of algorithmic thinking and manipulation of arrays. It doesn't require advanced programming skills but it does test an understanding of array operations and the ability to determine patterns or properties within the data.

   The category for this problem could be 'Array Manipulation' or 'Sorting Algorithms', with a sub-category being 'Circular Array' due to the right shift operation mentioned in the problem. This type of problem is often found in technical interviews and coding assessments, especially those related to data structures and algorithms.

   The complexity of this problem is linear (O(n)), as it requires iterating over each element in the array once to check if a sorted version of the array can be obtained by performing right shifts. However, there are no nested loops or recursive calls, which makes the problem more efficient and less complex compared to other problems that could have exponential time complexity.
