 This problem can be categorized as a basic level problem in programming. It falls under the category of algorithmic problems and string manipulation. The task involves iterating through a list of strings and comparing their lengths to find the longest one. If there are multiple strings with the same length, we need to return the first one. If the input list is empty, we should return None.

   In terms of difficulty, this problem can be considered easy as it only requires basic knowledge of iterating through a list and comparing values. The required programming skills mainly include understanding how to handle lists in a particular language, using conditional statements, and working with string lengths. The complexity of the problem is linear (O(n)) since we need to check each element in the list once.

   Overall, I would categorize this problem as an introductory-level algorithmic problem that tests basic programming skills and understanding of lists and strings.
