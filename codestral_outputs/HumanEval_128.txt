 Based on the provided information about the problem, we can make an analysis to classify it into a certain category:

1. **Difficulty Level:** Easy to Medium
   The problem requires understanding of array operations, looping through elements, calculation of signs (positive/negative), and simple mathematical operations like multiplication and addition. It doesn't have complex algorithmic concepts or data structures involved which makes it an easy to medium level problem.

2. **Programming Skills Required:** Basic Array Manipulation, Conditional Statements, Loops
   The solution would require basic understanding of programming constructs such as loops to iterate through the array elements, conditional statements to check for signs of numbers and simple mathematical operations. No advanced data structures or algorithms are required.

3. **Complexity:** Linear Time Complexity
   The problem can be solved using a single pass over the array which results in a linear time complexity - O(n), where n is the size of the input array. This makes it an efficient solution for larger inputs as well.
