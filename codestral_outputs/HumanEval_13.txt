 The problem falls under the category of "Easy to Medium" in terms of difficulty level. It's a classic algorithmic problem that involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

   In programming skills, this problem primarily tests the understanding of loops and recursion, as well as the ability to implement mathematical algorithms in code.

   Complexity-wise, the time complexity of the Euclidean algorithm is O(log(min(a, b))), making it an efficient solution for calculating the GCD. Therefore, the problem is not considered highly complex from this perspective.
