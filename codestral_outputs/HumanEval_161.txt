 This problem can be categorized as an easy-level problem that primarily tests a programmer's ability to manipulate strings in Python. The string operations involved, such as checking if a character is a letter, reversing the case of a letter, and reversing the entire string, are common tasks and not too complex. There isn't much algorithmic thinking required for this problem; it mainly relies on understanding how to use built-in Python functions to manipulate strings. Therefore, this would be an appropriate problem for beginners or intermediates who have a solid grasp of basic string operations in Python.
