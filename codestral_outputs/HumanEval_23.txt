 This problem can be categorized as a basic level problem in terms of difficulty and programming skills. Here's why:

1. Difficulty: The problem is to find the length of a given string which is a common operation in many programming languages. It does not require any complex algorithms or data structures. Hence, it can be considered a beginner-level problem.

2. Required Programming Skills: To solve this problem, one needs to know how to define a function, understand the syntax of their programming language, and utilize built-in string functions or methods to find the length of a string. These are basic skills that every programmer should possess in any programming language.

3. Complexity: In terms of complexity, this problem is O(1) because finding the length of a string is a constant time operation in most programming languages as they store the length of the string. Therefore, the complexity is not dependent on the size of the input.
