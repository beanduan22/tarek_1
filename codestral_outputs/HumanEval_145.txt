 The problem can be categorized as a sorting problem with a custom comparison function. Given that it requires sorting of integers based on a specific rule (sum of their digits), it can be considered to be of moderate difficulty. A good understanding of sorting algorithms in general and custom comparison functions is required to solve the problem. The complexity of this problem would be O(n log n) due to the sorting algorithm used, where 'n' represents the number of integers in the input list.

   Python skills are necessary to solve this problem as it requires knowledge of handling lists and implementing custom comparison functions for sorting. This task can also help improve a programmer's understanding of how the built-in sorting function works with custom comparators and how stable sorting algorithms preserve order in cases of equal keys (like sum of digits in our case).
