 This problem can be categorized as a "Dynamic Programming" problem with medium difficulty. The task involves writing a function to compute the n-th element of a sequence defined by a recursive formula. The challenge here is to optimize this computation to be more efficient. Given that the formula refers to previous three elements, a simple approach would be to use memoization (storing and reusing already computed values) to avoid redundant calculations. This solution would require solid programming skills and an understanding of recursion or iteration, as well as dynamic programming principles. The complexity of this problem is O(n), which can be considered manageable for large inputs within reasonable time limits.
