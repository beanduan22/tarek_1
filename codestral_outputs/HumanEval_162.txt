 This problem falls into the category of "Easy" to "Moderate". It requires a basic understanding of hash functions like MD5 and how to use them in a programming context. The task is to create a function that takes a string as input and returns its MD5 hash equivalent string, or None if the input string is empty. This is a common problem type for beginners to intermediate programmers and it mainly tests their ability to use built-in functions and understand basic cryptographic hashing.
