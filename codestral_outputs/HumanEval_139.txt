 Category: Basic Algorithms -> Recursion or Loops

   Explanation: This problem can be solved using a simple loop that calculates the factorial of each number from n down to 1 and multiplies them together. The input is an integer and the output will also be an integer. The difficulty level is considered basic because it only requires knowledge of loops or recursion, which are common concepts in programming. However, if the input can potentially be very large, this problem could become more complex due to potential limitations on calculating factorials for very large numbers. This doesn't seem to be a concern here as the problem statement doesn't mention large numbers.
