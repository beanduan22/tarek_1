 Based on the problem description, this is a medium-level problem that requires understanding of lists in Python and manipulating nested lists (similar to matrices). It also involves sorting operations. The difficulty level can be considered as intermediate because it combines several simple concepts into one problem. This problem does not require advanced programming skills or complex algorithms but rather practical application of basic concepts such as list iteration, tuple generation, and sorting. Therefore, I would categorize this problem as an Intermediate Level Problem.
