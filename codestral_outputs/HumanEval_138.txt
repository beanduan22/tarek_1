 The problem "is_equal_to_sum_even" can be categorized as a basic problem in number theory and algorithmic thinking. Given its simplicity, this problem can be considered as an easy level problem for beginners to intermediate programmers who are comfortable with mathematical concepts and programming fundamentals.

   Here's the analysis:

   1. Difficulty Level: Easy - The problem statement is clear, and it doesn't require complex algorithms or mathematical proofs. It checks a simple condition about a number being written as a sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.
   2. Required Programming Skills: Basic knowledge of programming constructs (if-else statements) and arithmetic operations would be sufficient to solve this problem. No advanced data structures or algorithms are needed.
   3. Complexity: The time complexity of the function is O(1), meaning it takes constant time to execute, as it only performs a single check on the input number. The space complexity is also O(1) because no extra memory is used that scales with the size of the input.
