 Category: Basic Algorithm Implementation (Easy)

   Difficulty: The problem is considered easy because it mainly focuses on implementing a basic conditional statement and understanding how to determine if a number is prime or not.

   Required Programming Skills: Understanding of conditionals, functions, and basic mathematical concepts such as determining whether a number is prime.

   Complexity: The time complexity for this problem primarily depends on the algorithm used to check for primality. A simple method like checking divisibility up to the square root of n will have a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)). But since we're dealing with smaller numbers here, it should be fast enough for practical purposes. Space complexity is minimal as only a few variables are used.
