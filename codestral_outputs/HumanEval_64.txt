 Based on the provided information, I can analyze this as a beginner-level problem that primarily tests basic string manipulation and conditional logic skills. The function `vowels_count` is straightforward: it takes a string as input and returns an integer representing the count of vowels in the string. The complexity appears to be linear, O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we're traversing the string once to check each character.

   As for required programming skills, this problem primarily tests understanding of strings and arrays (since strings are essentially arrays of characters in many languages). It also requires knowledge of conditional statements to handle the special case where 'y' is considered a vowel only when it appears at the end of the word.

   Therefore, I would categorize this problem as a basic level string manipulation and logic problem that most programmers should be able to solve with minimal difficulty.
