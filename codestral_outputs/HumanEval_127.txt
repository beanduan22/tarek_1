 This is a medium-level problem that falls under the category of Mathematics and Algorithms. It requires understanding of basic set theory (intersection) and number theory (prime numbers). The solution involves determining if the length of the intersection between two intervals is a prime number or not. The task itself does not have complex data structures, but it has a moderate level of logical complexity since we need to consider various edge cases for interval overlapping. The main challenge might be handling negative numbers and ensuring that the program correctly determines whether a number is prime.

   In terms of programming skills required, a knowledge in Python syntax, functions, if-else statements, and basic mathematical operations would suffice to solve this problem. However, the complexity in determining prime numbers might require more thought and algorithmic thinking. Overall, this problem can be considered medium to high level for beginners but could be quite straightforward for individuals with some programming experience.
