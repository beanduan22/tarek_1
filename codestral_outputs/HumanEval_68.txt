 The problem can be classified as a medium level problem since it involves list traversal to find a specific value and requires basic understanding of list indexing. It falls under the category of array problems. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we need to iterate through all the elements once to find our answer. There are no complex data structures or algorithms required, making it a good problem for beginners and intermediates who have a good grasp on list operations and indexing. However, this problem doesn't involve any sort of optimization problems or recursion that might classify it as an advanced level problem.
