 This is a problem that can be categorized as a basic level problem in the field of string manipulation or parsing. It checks if every opening bracket '(' has a corresponding closing bracket ')'. The complexity is linear as it only requires iterating over the string once to solve the problem.

   As for difficulty, I would classify this as an easy-to-medium level problem. A beginner might have trouble understanding how to check every opening bracket, while a more advanced programmer could likely solve it with ease. The required programming skills include understanding basic string manipulation and control flow structures (like loops and conditionals).

   In summary, this is an easy-to-medium level problem that primarily tests the ability to parse strings and manage control flow effectively.
