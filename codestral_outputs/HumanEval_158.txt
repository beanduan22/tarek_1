 This is a medium-level problem that tests the following skills:

1. Function Definition: The problem requires defining a function to solve it.
2. List Traversal: The solution will involve traversing through each string in the list to check its characteristics.
3. String Manipulation: The algorithm will require examining each character of the strings to determine their uniqueness.
4. Logic Implementation: The problem requires implementing a strategy to compare words based on the number of unique characters and lexicographical order if needed.
5. Testing: The problem provides test cases which can be used for validating the solution.

   This problem can be classified as a medium-level algorithmic problem that tests string manipulation and logical implementation skills. It doesn't require advanced data structures or complex algorithms.
