 The problem is categorized as a medium-level problem in terms of difficulty. It requires the understanding of basic programming concepts such as loops and conditional statements, and it also involves list manipulation. However, to solve this problem efficiently, especially for large lists, more advanced techniques like sorting or hashing could be used.

   The complexity of this problem can be analyzed as follows:
   1. If the solution uses three nested loops to check every possible combination, then the time complexity would be O(n^3), where n is the number of elements in the list. This approach is not efficient for large lists and won't pass for inputs with a large size.
   2. However, if the solution sorts the input list first (which takes O(n log n) time), then we can iterate through the sorted list once to check each element against the other elements using two pointers, which would result in a time complexity of O(n^2). This approach is more efficient and suitable for larger lists.
   3. In terms of space complexity, if no additional data structure is used apart from the input list (ignoring the space needed by function call stack), then the space complexity would be O(1). If a new data structure like a hash map or set is used, then the space complexity could increase to O(n) in the worst case.

   In summary, the problem is a medium-level problem that requires understanding of list manipulation and possibly sorting or hashing for efficient solutions. The time complexity can vary based on the solution approach, with one possible efficient approach having a time complexity of O(n^2).
