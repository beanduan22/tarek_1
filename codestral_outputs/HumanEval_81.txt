 Category: Basic/Intermediate

    This problem can be categorized as a basic or intermediate level problem because it tests knowledge of conditional statements and arrays in a programming language. The task is to write a function that takes an array of GPA scores and converts each score into a corresponding letter grade according to a given table. The difficulty lies in correctly implementing the conversion logic based on the provided conditions. This problem does not require advanced algorithms, data structures, or complex mathematical computations. It's primarily about manipulating data and making decisions using conditional statements, which is a common concept taught in introductory programming courses.
