 This is a problem that can be classified as medium-difficulty in terms of coding skills and problem-solving abilities. Here's an analysis:

1. Difficulty Level: Medium
The task involves using two lists to build and evaluate an algebraic expression, which requires knowledge of basic operations in python (list manipulation) and understanding how operator precedence works in mathematics. Therefore, I would classify this as a medium-difficulty problem.

2. Programming Skills Required: Python, Basic Operations on Lists, Operator Precedence
The problem is primarily focused on using Python to solve the task. A basic understanding of lists and list operations in python is necessary. Additionally, it requires understanding how operators work and their precedence rules.

3. Complexity: Medium
This problem has a moderate level of complexity. It involves parsing two lists and performing calculations based on the input. However, the complexity can be minimized by using Python's built-in functions for mathematical operations and list manipulation. The worst-case time complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the operand list since it may need to iterate through all elements once.

In summary, this problem can be solved using Python's basic operations on lists and understanding operator precedence rules. It requires a moderate level of programming skills and has a medium complexity level.
