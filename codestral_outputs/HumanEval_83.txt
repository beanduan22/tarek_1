 The problem falls under the category of mathematics and dynamic programming. It can be solved using number theory concepts as well but since it asks for a count which suggests a combinatorial solution, dynamic programming is likely to be more efficient. However, the exact difficulty depends on whether or not the programmer is familiar with these topics; if they are, then this problem could be considered medium in difficulty. If not, then it may be considered hard since it requires knowledge of both mathematical principles and programming skills.

   This problem involves two scenarios: numbers that start or end with 1. It's important to note that there is an overlap between these two cases (single-digit numbers are included in both). To count the total number of such n-digit integers, we can calculate the counts for the two scenarios separately and then subtract the size of their intersection.

   For a number starting with 1, it's essentially a problem of finding the count of (n-1)-digit numbers since we already have the '1'. Similarly, for a number ending in 1, it's equivalent to finding the count of (n-1)-digit numbers.

   However, this approach results in counting single-digit numbers twice which need to be subtracted once. The base cases are when n equals 0 and 1 where we return 0 and 2 respectively as there is no single digit number and two one-digit numbers (1 and 10) that meet the conditions.

   So, using dynamic programming to solve this problem would involve building a table of values for the function described above, starting with base cases and building up to the desired value of n, then subtracting the intersection as mentioned earlier.
