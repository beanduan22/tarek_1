 Category: Easy-Medium

   This problem can be categorized as an 'Easy-Medium' level problem because it involves iterating through a list to compare elements, but does not require complex data structures or algorithms. To solve this problem, you need basic programming skills in Python and a good understanding of looping constructs. The time complexity is linear O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

   Here's how one could approach solving this problem:

   1. Initialize a variable `max_index` to -1. This variable will store the largest index of an element that does not meet the condition (i.e., it is greater than its preceding element).
   2. Loop through the array, starting from the second element (since there's no previous element for the first one).
   3. For each iteration, check if the current element is less than or equal to the previous element. If this condition holds true, update `max_index` with the current index.
   4. After the loop ends, return `max_index`. This will be the largest index of an element that does not meet the condition, or -1 if no such element exists.
