 The problem can be categorized as "Easy to Medium" in terms of difficulty. This is because it requires knowledge of how to extract digits from a number and apply a simple condition (even or odd). The complexity is O(logN) since we are processing each digit once, where N is the input number. However, the programming skills required are basic to intermediate as it involves working with numbers and conditional statements. Therefore, I would categorize this problem as "Beginner to Intermediate".
