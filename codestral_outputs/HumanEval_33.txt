 Based on the given problem:

- Difficulty level: Medium
This is because the problem involves manipulating list elements based on their indices and sorting specific elements of a list. However, these are common operations in Python, so it's not overly complex if the individual knows how to work with lists and slicing in Python.

- Required programming skills: Basic knowledge of Python programming language, especially working with lists and list comprehension. Familiarity with sorting functions will be beneficial but isn't strictly necessary for solving this problem.

- Complexity: Low to Medium
This is because the time complexity could potentially be O(n log n) due to the sorting operation. However, it's important to note that only a third of the list elements are sorted in place, which might reduce the actual time complexity compared to sorting the entire list. The space complexity is O(n), considering we create a new list l'.

- Category: Array or List Manipulation with Sorting
This problem falls under this category as it primarily tests the ability to manipulate elements of an array (or in Python's case, a list) based on certain conditions and perform sorting operations.
