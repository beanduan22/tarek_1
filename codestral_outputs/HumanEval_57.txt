 The problem is about writing a Python function that checks whether a list of numbers are monotonically increasing or decreasing. This is a common algorithmic problem that can be solved with basic programming skills.

   Category:
      - Beginner to Intermediate (depending on the programmer's familiarity with Python and programming concepts)

   Skills Required:
      - Familiarity with Python programming language
      - Understanding of lists and loops
      - Ability to iterate through a list and compare elements

   Complexity:
      - Time complexity is O(n) since the function needs to iterate through all n elements in the list once.
      - Space complexity is O(1) as only a few variables are used regardless of the size of the input list.
