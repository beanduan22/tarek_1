 Based on the given problem, I would categorize it as a basic level problem. This is because:

1. Difficulty Level: The problem requires understanding of list manipulation and conditional statements which are fundamental concepts in any programming language. Thus, I'd classify this problem as easy to moderate level.

2. Required Programming Skills: To solve this problem, you need a basic understanding of Python, especially working with lists and loops. You should also be comfortable using conditional statements.

3. Complexity: In terms of complexity, it's O(n), which means the time required to check if all elements in the list are sorted or not increases linearly with the size of the input list. Thus, this problem can be solved efficiently even for large lists.
