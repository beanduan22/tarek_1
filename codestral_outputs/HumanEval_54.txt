 This problem can be categorized as a "Easy" level problem in terms of difficulty. It's a basic algorithmic problem that requires understanding of string manipulation and comparison. The required programming skill includes knowledge in handling strings and basic looping constructs.

    Complexity-wise, it is relatively straightforward. You can iterate through each character in the first string and check if that character exists in the second string. If a character doesn't exist or its frequency in the second string is less than in the first one, then the function should return False. This operation is expected to be O(n), where n is the length of the longer string.

    In Python, you can easily solve this problem by using Counter from collections module which counts the frequency of each character in a string and then comparing these counters for equality.

    The category would therefore be: Easy, String manipulation & comparison, O(n) complexity.
