 The problem can be categorized as a medium-difficulty problem that primarily tests a good understanding of bit manipulation and sorting algorithms in programming. It doesn't require specific advanced skills or knowledge beyond those typically expected at an intermediate to advanced level for a programmer. The problem involves multiple steps - converting integers to binary, counting the number of ones in the binary representation, and then sorting the array based on these counts. The complexity of this problem would be O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where 'n' is the length of the input array.
