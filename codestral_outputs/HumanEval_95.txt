 This problem can be categorized as a Beginner level problem in Python programming. It's relatively straightforward to solve if you have basic knowledge of working with dictionaries and string manipulation in Python. The problem doesn't involve any complex data structures or algorithms, which makes it an ideal choice for beginners. However, it does require understanding the use of loops and conditionals to iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary. It also requires knowledge of built-in functions such as `isupper()` and `islower()`.
