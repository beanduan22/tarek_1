 The problem can be categorized as a beginner-level problem. It requires basic knowledge of working with arrays or lists in Python and performing elementwise operations on them. Here's why:

1. Difficulty Level: Beginner to Intermediate - The problem involves manipulating two arrays of the same length, which is a common data structure used for such tasks. However, understanding how to iterate over these arrays or use list comprehensions may be a bit more advanced than basic level knowledge.
2. Required Programming Skills: Basic Python programming skills and familiarity with working with arrays or lists in Python are necessary. Understanding the abs() function and elementwise operations is also required for solving this problem.
3. Complexity: Linear (O(n)) - Since we're only iterating over each list once to calculate differences, the complexity of this problem is linear. This makes it a relatively easy problem compared to more complex problems like sorting or searching algorithms that often have higher time complexity.
