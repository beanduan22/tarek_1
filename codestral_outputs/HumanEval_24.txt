 Based on the problem description, this problem can be categorized as an "Easy" level problem in terms of difficulty. This is because the problem statement only requires us to find the largest divisor for a given number that is smaller than the number itself. To solve this, we simply need to iterate from `n-1` down to 1 and check if each number evenly divides `n`. Once we find such a number, we return it as our solution.

   In terms of required programming skills, this problem requires basic knowledge in Python programming language and simple looping constructs. It doesn't require any advanced data structures or algorithms.

   In terms of complexity, the time complexity for this function is O(n) because in the worst case scenario we may have to iterate through all numbers from 1 up to n. The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of space to store our variables.
