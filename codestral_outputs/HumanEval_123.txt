 This problem can be classified into the category of "Intermediate" in terms of difficulty. It requires a solid understanding of Python programming language and a basic knowledge of mathematical concepts such as sequences and collatz conjecture. The problem is not too complex but it does require implementing a loop to generate the collatz sequence, checking conditions within the loop, and sorting the final list. This makes it a good problem for people who are comfortable with these concepts and have some experience in Python programming.

   However, due to its mathematical nature, this problem could also be classified into the category of "Algorithmic" problems as well, given that understanding the collatz conjecture is more about algorithmic thinking rather than just simple problem-solving skills. It's important to note that while not overly complicated, it does require a good grasp on control flow and data structures in Python. Therefore, this problem can be considered both an intermediate programming exercise as well as an introductory algorithmic problem.
