 Category: Basic Programming

   This problem can be solved using basic programming concepts such as lists, loops, conditionals, and arithmetic operations. The level of difficulty is considered easy to moderate. This problem assumes a familiarity with list traversal and simple conditional statements. No advanced data structures or algorithms are required for solving this problem.

   It's important to note that the problem statement explicitly asks to ignore negative numbers and non-integers, which adds an extra layer of complexity compared to a simpler version where all numbers are processed without any conditions.

   In terms of time complexity, iterating over each number in the list once will result in O(n) time complexity, where n is the size of the input list.
