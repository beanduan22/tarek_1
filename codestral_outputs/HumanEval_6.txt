 This is a programming problem that can be categorized as "medium" in terms of difficulty. It requires good understanding of string manipulation and recursion or iterative approach to find out the maximum depth of nested parentheses. The solution would involve parsing through each character of the input string, maintaining a count or stack to keep track of opening and closing parentheses, and updating a list with the maximum depth for each group. It's important to note that this problem does not require advanced data structures or algorithms; it is more about correctly interpreting and implementing the logic.
