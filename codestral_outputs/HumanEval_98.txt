 This is a basic programming problem that falls under the "string processing" or "algorithmic problem-solving" categories. It requires a foundational understanding of how to iterate through strings in Python and perform conditional checks. The difficulty level can be considered EASY as it doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms. This is more about understanding the syntax and concepts of string manipulation and conditional statements rather than complex problem-solving skills.
