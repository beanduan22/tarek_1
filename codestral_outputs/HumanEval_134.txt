 - Category: Beginner to Intermediate
   - Difficulty: Easy
   - Required Skills: Basic String Manipulation in Python
   - Complexity: Low to Medium

Explanation:
This is a beginner-to-intermediate level problem that primarily tests the understanding of string manipulation in Python. The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` takes a string as an input and returns True or False based on whether the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. It's an easy problem that doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms, making it suitable for beginners to intermediate level programmers. However, understanding how to check if a character is an alphabet in Python and handling edge cases (such as an empty string) increases the complexity slightly.
