 The given problem is categorized as an "Easy" level problem in terms of difficulty and complexity. It falls under the category of filtering/processing lists and checking conditions related to digits within numbers, which are basic programming concepts. Here's a breakdown:

   - Difficulty: Easy
     Reason: The task involves iterating over a list of integers, checking each digit of these integers for evenness, and sorting the final result. This is a common beginner-level problem in programming that doesn't require advanced algorithms or data structures.

   - Required Programming Skills: Basic Python
     Reason: The problem statement uses Python syntax, making it likely that it was written to be solved using Python code. Therefore, familiarity with the basic concepts and syntax of Python is required to understand and solve this problem.

   - Complexity: O(n log n) due to sorting
     Reason: The time complexity mainly arises from iterating over each number in the list (which takes O(n)) and checking each digit for evenness (which takes O(d), where d is the number of digits in a number). Sorting the final list at the end has an average case complexity of O(n log n). However, since the problem statement doesn't specify that the numbers can be arbitrarily large, we can assume that this won't significantly affect the overall time complexity.
