 The problem can be categorized as a basic level problem given that it only requires filtering out integer values from a list containing various data types using Python's built-in functions or methods. No complex algorithms are needed to solve this issue. Thus, the problem falls under the category of "Basic".

   As for the required programming skills, since we're working with Python, the solution would require knowledge about lists and their manipulation in Python, which is a fundamental skill that most beginners learn while getting started with Python. So, this problem can be categorized as "Beginner".

   In terms of complexity, the problem involves iterating over each element in the list once to check if it's an integer, making its time complexity linear - O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. Hence, the problem falls under the category of "Low Complexity" or "Efficient".
