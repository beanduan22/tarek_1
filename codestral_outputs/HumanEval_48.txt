 Based on the given problem, it can be analyzed as follows:

- Difficulty level: The problem is of a beginner to intermediate level as it requires understanding basic string manipulation in Python.
- Required programming skills: The primary skill required to solve this problem is working with strings and basic control flow (if statements).
- Complexity: The complexity of the problem lies mainly in the need to handle edge cases, such as an empty string which is considered a palindrome by definition. However, it's not particularly complex because we just have to compare characters at both ends of the string until they don't match or we've reached the middle.

So, based on these factors, I would categorize this problem as "Intermediate-level".
