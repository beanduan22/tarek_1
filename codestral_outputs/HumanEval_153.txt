 This problem can be categorized as a medium-level problem in the field of programming. It requires some knowledge of string manipulation and list iteration in Python. The level of difficulty is moderate because the task involves iterating through a list, calculating a value for each element based on its character composition, and then making a decision based on those values.

   This problem can be solved using Python programming language due to its simplicity and readability. It does not require advanced data structures or algorithms. However, it is important to have a good understanding of string manipulation methods such as `isupper()` and `islower()`, list iteration, and basic mathematical operations in order to solve this problem efficiently.

   The complexity of the problem can be considered low to moderate. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of extensions, because we need to iterate through all extensions once to calculate their strengths. The space complexity is also O(n) since we store the extensions in a list and additional variables for each extension's strength, name, and count of uppercase and lowercase letters.
