 Based on the given information and the provided function signature in Python:

- Difficulty: Easy
    This is an easy problem because it only requires understanding of list comprehensions or built-in filter functions to solve. No advanced data structures or algorithms are required.

- Required programming skills: Beginner - Intermediate
   A basic knowledge of the Python language, specifically how to manipulate lists and strings, would be sufficient to solve this problem. However, using a more sophisticated approach such as regular expressions might require an intermediate level of skill.

- Complexity: Linear
    The time complexity for this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because it iterates over each element of the list exactly once. The space complexity is also linear, as it creates a new list to store the output.
