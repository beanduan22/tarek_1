 The problem can be categorized as a basic level algorithmic problem. It doesn't have complex data structures or algorithms to solve it but rather involves simple array traversal and conditional checks to filter out elements with at most two digits. This problem primarily tests the ability of an individual to write clean, understandable code and perform basic operations on arrays.

   Difficulty: Basic / Easy
   Required Skills: Programming basics (loops, conditionals), array manipulation
   Complexity: Time complexity is O(k) as we only need to iterate through the first k elements of the array once. Space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
