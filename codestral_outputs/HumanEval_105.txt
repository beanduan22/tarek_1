 Based on the given information, this is a moderate-level problem that requires basic understanding of sorting algorithms and string manipulation in Python. The primary steps include filtering numbers between 1 and 9, sorting them, reversing the sorted list, and then replacing each number with its corresponding English name. This does not require any advanced data structures or complex algorithms.

   Therefore, this problem can be categorized as a basic programming exercise that tests understanding of array manipulation and conditional statements in Python.
