 The given problem is a basic encryption problem that involves shifting letters of an input string by a certain amount. This kind of problem falls under the category of "Cryptography" or "String Manipulation". The difficulty level of this problem can be considered EASY to MODERATE as it only requires understanding of character manipulation and encryption techniques. It doesn't require any advanced programming skills, but a good understanding of the alphabet and its ordinal values would be beneficial. The complexity of this problem is O(n) where 'n' is the length of the input string since we are iterating over each character once to perform the encryption.
