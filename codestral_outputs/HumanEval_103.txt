 This problem can be categorized as a medium-level problem. Here's why:

Difficulty: The problem itself is not complex, but it requires understanding of basic arithmetic operations and binary conversion. Therefore, someone who is new to programming might find it moderately challenging. However, for those with some programming experience, it should be considered easy to medium in difficulty.

Required Programming Skills: To solve this problem, one needs a basic understanding of programming logic and operations such as loops or arithmetic calculations. Also, knowledge of binary conversion is required to convert the rounded average to its binary representation.

Complexity: The complexity of this problem lies mainly in understanding the problem statement correctly. Once that's done, it's a matter of implementing the necessary steps - calculating the average, rounding off to the nearest integer, and converting to binary - which are all simple operations. Therefore, the time complexity can be considered linear O(n) as we might have to iterate over n to m numbers to calculate the sum for the average. The space complexity is constant O(1) as we only need a few variables to store our results.

Overall, this problem can be categorized as medium-level due to its requirements of basic arithmetic operations and binary conversion, which might pose a challenge to beginners but are straightforward for those with some programming experience.
