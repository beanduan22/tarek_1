 Based on the provided problem description, here is an analysis:

1. Difficulty: This problem can be considered of medium difficulty. It involves iterating through a list to find specific conditions (negative or positive integers) and then comparing these values to find the largest or smallest one. The main challenge lies in handling edge cases correctly such as empty lists or lists with no negative/positive integers.
2. Required programming skills: This problem requires basic understanding of Python, including list manipulation, conditional statements, and return types (tuples). Knowledge of error handling can be beneficial for managing the edge case inputs.
3. Complexity: The time complexity of this function is O(n) because it needs to iterate through all elements in the input list once. Space complexity is also O(n) since a new list might need to be created, depending on how the implementation handles separating negative and positive integers. However, if we're only storing one value (largest neg and smallest pos), then space complexity could be considered as constant - O(1).

   Based on these analyses, I would categorize this problem under the "Intermediate" level problems, focusing more on algorithmic thinking and edge case handling.
