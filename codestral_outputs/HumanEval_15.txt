 This problem can be categorized as a Beginner level problem because it is simple to understand and solve. It involves using basic programming concepts such as loops and string manipulation. The problem's complexity is linear (O(n)) since we have to iterate through the range of numbers from 0 to n to generate the sequence. No advanced data structures or algorithms are required, making it suitable for a beginner programmer.

   To solve this problem, you can use a loop that starts from 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches n. Within each iteration of the loop, convert the number to a string and append it to the final output string. A space character should be appended between numbers.
