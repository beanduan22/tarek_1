 The given problem can be classified as a Basic to Intermediate level problem in the category of String Manipulation problems. It doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms but understanding of string manipulation and basic sorting is crucial. Here are the reasons for this classification:

1. Difficulty: The problem is not very complex. It requires splitting a sentence into words, then sorting the characters in each word, and finally joining them back together to form the ordered version. This can be done using simple string manipulation functions and basic sorting algorithms available in most programming languages. However, the complexity can increase if there are additional constraints or requirements not clearly mentioned in the problem statement.
2. Required Programming Skills: The solution of this problem requires a good understanding of how to handle strings and arrays (or lists) in a program. It also demands knowledge of how to use loops for iterating over each word and character, as well as a basic sorting algorithm to rearrange the characters in each word. These are fundamental skills that every programmer should possess, making this problem suitable for beginners to intermediate level programmers.
3. Complexity: The time complexity of this problem is O(n log n), where 'n' is the length of the input string. This is because we need to sort each word in the string, which takes O(log n) time, and we do it for all words in the string, giving us a total time complexity of O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n), as we are creating new strings for the ordered version. However, considering that 'n' is typically not very large (as compared to other problems like sorting arrays or searching in graphs), this problem can be considered relatively simple in terms of time and space complexity.

In conclusion, based on its difficulty level, required programming skills, and complexity, I would classify the given problem as a Basic to Intermediate level String Manipulation problem.
