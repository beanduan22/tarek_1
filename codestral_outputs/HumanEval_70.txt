 Based on the provided information, this problem can be classified as a medium-level programming problem. It requires basic knowledge of lists and sorting algorithms in Python. The main challenge is to implement the strange sorting mechanism described in the problem statement. This involves iterating over the list, selecting the minimum and maximum values at each step, and appending them to a new list in an alternating pattern.

Here's how I would approach this:
1. Sort the input list.
2. Initialize an empty result list.
3. While there are still elements in the sorted list, append the smallest element (which is now at the beginning of the list) to the result list and remove it from the sorted list.
4. If there are any elements left in the sorted list, append the largest element (which is now at the end of the list) to the result list and remove it from the sorted list.
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all elements have been processed.
6. Return the result list.
