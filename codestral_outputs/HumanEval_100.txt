 This problem is categorized as an "Easy" to "Medium" level programming problem due to its simplicity in structure but requires a basic understanding of Python syntax and control flow structures like loops. It does not necessitate advanced data structures or algorithms, making it suitable for beginners to intermediate programmers.

The category could be further defined as:
- Algorithmic Problem (Since it involves creating an algorithm to solve the problem)
- Looping Problem (As we need to iterate through a sequence of numbers)
- Conditional Problem (As it requires checks on whether n is odd or even)

The overall complexity would be O(n), as in the worst case scenario, we will have to perform an operation (add to the list) for each value up to n.
