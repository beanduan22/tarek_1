 The problem is a basic implementation of a mathematical formula to calculate the area of a triangle. It falls into the "Beginner" category as it doesn't require advanced mathematics or complex algorithms. However, it does test some basic understanding of how functions work in programming. Therefore, it would be suitable for beginners who have a foundational knowledge of their chosen programming language. The complexity level is low as we only need to implement one function and the mathematical formula to calculate triangle area is quite simple (0.5 * base * height).
