 This problem can be categorized as an "Easy" problem in terms of difficulty because it mainly involves iterating over a list of strings and checking if each character is odd. However, the description adds a twist by requiring to modify a sentence template with these counts which increases the complexity slightly.

   In terms of programming skills required, you would need a basic understanding of Python's syntax and handling data structures such as lists and strings. Experience with string manipulation methods and list comprehensions would be beneficial but not strictly necessary.

   This problem can also be categorized as an "Algorithmic" problem because it requires implementing a specific algorithm to solve the task. Specifically, this task involves creating a function that iterates over each string in the input list, counts the number of odd digits in each string, and then formats these counts into new strings using a provided template.

   Therefore, I would categorize this problem as "Easy-to-Medium" Algorithmic problem based on its complexity and required skills.
