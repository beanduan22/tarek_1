 This problem can be categorized as a beginner to intermediate level problem in Python.

   Difficulty Level: Beginner - Intermediate

   Required Programming Skills: Basic understanding of Python syntax, loops, conditionals, and working with strings and numbers. Knowledge of binary representation of numbers is an added advantage but not mandatory.

   Complexity: The complexity of this problem is O(log N) because in the worst case scenario, we need to traverse through all the digits of the number N which can be logarithmic in size for large values of N. However, since N has a maximum constraint of 10000, it makes the problem constant time complex as well.

   Analysis:
   1. The function `solve` takes an integer `N` as input.
   2. It converts this number into binary representation and calculates the sum of its digits.
   3. The result is a string representing the calculated sum in binary format.

   So, to solve this problem, we need to convert the decimal number into binary first (which can be done using Python's built-in `bin` function), then iterate through each digit of the binary number (excluding the '0b' prefix that Python adds for binary numbers) and add them up. Finally, we should return this sum as a string in binary format.
