 The problem seems to be a parsing task that involves string manipulation and pattern recognition, which can be considered as a basic to intermediate level problem. It falls under the category of "string parsing" and "pattern recognition". This kind of problem is common in algorithmic programming challenges and may require understanding of basic string operations and conditional statements. No advanced data structures or algorithms are needed for this task.

   The difficulty can be rated as easy to moderate, given that it requires iterating through the input string and mapping certain substrings (the musical notes) to specific integers. This doesn't involve any complex mathematical operations or recursive functions.

   The programming skills required include familiarity with basic string manipulation, looping constructs, conditional statements, and pattern recognition in strings. It should be noted that since this is a Python problem statement, proficiency in Python language is necessary to solve the problem.

   Overall, the complexity can be rated as low due to its straightforward nature and simple input structure.
