 The given problem is a pathfinding problem with unique constraints. It can be categorized as a medium-difficulty problem, because it requires understanding of 2D arrays (grids) and some pathfinding algorithms, but it's not overly complex. This type of problem often appears in coding interviews or competitive programming contests, and it tests the ability to solve algorithmic problems involving traversal through a grid-like structure.

   The problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking or Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, since we need to find the minimum path based on lexicographical order, it's better to use DFS as it naturally lends itself to this kind of problem.

   In terms of programming skills, this problem primarily tests the ability to work with grids and arrays in two dimensions. It also requires a good understanding of recursive algorithms for pathfinding. Therefore, it could be categorized as a problem that tests intermediate-level programming skills.

   The complexity of this problem can be analyzed as follows:

   - Time Complexity: O(N^2 * N!), where N is the size of the grid (number of rows or columns). This is because there are N*N starting points and at each step, we have N choices. However, since it's guaranteed that the answer is unique, we don't need to explore all paths and thus, in practice, this problem might run faster than its worst-case time complexity suggests.
   - Space Complexity: O(k), where k is the length of the path to be found. This space is required to store the current path being explored during DFS.
