 Problem Category: Basic Programming & Algorithms

This problem falls into the category of "basic programming" as it primarily tests a fundamental understanding of loops, conditionals, and list manipulation in Python. The problem does not require advanced data structures or complex algorithms to solve. It also doesn't have any specific performance requirements, which makes it less likely to fall into the "optimization" category.

The difficulty level of this problem is EASY as it only requires basic looping and conditional statements to check for even numbers between two given integers. This problem does not require a deep understanding of Python or programming in general, making it suitable for beginners as well.

As for the required skills, it primarily tests knowledge of:
- Basic Loops (for/while loops)
- Conditional Statements (if statements)
- List Manipulation (appending to lists)
- Basic understanding of even numbers and how to check for them in a program

Overall, this problem is more about demonstrating basic programming skills rather than showing advanced knowledge or problem-solving abilities. It's a good starting point for beginners to understand the structure and syntax of Python.
