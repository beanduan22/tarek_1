Based on the description provided, this problem falls into the "Easy" category. Here's why:

1. **Difficulty Level**: The problem involves basic mathematical concepts (integer cube checks) rather than complex algorithms or data structures.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: Solving this problem requires fundamental programming skills like function implementation and variable handling in Python. No advanced language features are needed; thus, it tests the ability to translate logic into code efficiently.

3. **Complexity**: The operation itself is straightforward (determining if a number is an integer cube), but one must handle cases where the input is negative or zero appropriately as well. This introduces some conditional logic which increases the problem's complexity slightly compared to basic arithmetic operations.

In summary, this programming task tests understanding of mathematical concepts and their application in a programming context with relatively simple implementation requirements. The problem likely serves as an introductory step for beginners looking to improve their coding skills.
