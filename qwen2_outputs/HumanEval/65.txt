Based on the description provided, this programming problem falls into a few different categories:

**Category: Difficulty Level**

- **Intermediate**: The problem involves basic operations in programming such as string manipulation and arithmetic calculations. However, understanding how to handle edge cases like when `shift` is greater than the number of digits might require some logical thinking.

**Category: Required Programming Skills**

- **String Manipulation & Arithmetic Operations**: To tackle this problem, you need skills in manipulating strings (retrieving substrings, concatenating strings) and performing arithmetic operations that involve determining digit count or calculating remainders/modulo operation to handle shifts greater than the number of digits.

**Category: Complexity**

- **Linear Time Complexity**: The algorithm required here will iterate through the input integer once, converting it into a string (or vice versa if doing reverse), which is considered linear time complexity (`O(n)`). However, additional checks need to be performed based on the `shift` value relative to the length of the number. This doesn't significantly increase complexity but introduces conditional logic.

Overall, this problem requires basic programming skills and an understanding of string manipulation and arithmetic operations while presenting a bit of challenge through the handling of edge cases (like when shifts exceed the number of digits). Thus, it could be considered suitable for an intermediate-level coding assessment or exercise.
