The problem falls under the category of "Easy" problems in terms of difficulty, as it requires basic understanding of arithmetic operations, conditional checks, and function implementation in a programming language.

Required Programming Skills:

1. Basic knowledge of arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (though not used here).

2. Conditional logic using 'if-else' statements to check conditions based on the input parameters.

3. Function definition and usage.

Complexity:

The problem's complexity is minimal due to its straightforward nature. It involves simple checks for given conditions and does not require complex algorithms or data structures.

In summary, this problem tests basic programming skills like function creation and conditional execution in a context involving arithmetic operations on integers.
