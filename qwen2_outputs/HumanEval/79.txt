The given problem can be categorized as:

**Difficulty**: Medium

This is because it requires basic understanding of number conversions between different numeral systems (decimal to binary) and string manipulation. Students should have a fundamental grasp of arithmetic operations in Python.

**Required Programming Skills**:
1. **Basic Function Writing**: The student needs to write their own function logic without using built-in functions explicitly for the conversion process.
2. **String Handling**: Since the final output is expected as a string, students need to understand how to concatenate strings and format them correctly.

**Complexity**:
The problem introduces several aspects that can make it moderately complex:

1. **Formatting the Output String**: Students will have to manage the "db" prefix and suffix in the binary number string.
2. **Binary Number Conversion Logic**: Converting a decimal number into its binary representation involves understanding of division and modulo operations repeatedly, which might be a bit tricky for beginners.

This problem tests both basic programming skills (function creation) as well as logical reasoning skills needed to manage different aspects of the output format. It's suitable for intermediate learners who have been introduced to string manipulation and simple arithmetic operations in Python.
