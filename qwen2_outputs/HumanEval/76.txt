The given problem can be categorized under the following aspects:

**Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced.

This classification implies that while it might require some experience with basic programming concepts like functions, math operations (exponentiation in this case), and logical conditions; it also necessitates a certain level of analytical thinking and understanding of floating-point precision issues when dealing with real numbers.

**Required Programming Skills**:

1. **Basic Functionality**: Understanding how to define and use simple functions, including parameters and return values.
2. **Mathematical Operations**: Proficiency in mathematical operations such as exponentiation using the `**` operator in Python or similar methods in other programming languages.
3. **Conditional Logic**: Ability to implement conditions using Boolean expressions for if-else statements (e.g., to check whether x is a simple power of n).

**Complexity**:

The problem's complexity lies primarily in dealing with floating-point numbers and ensuring that the solution accurately reflects mathematical principles while accounting for computational constraints.

To address this, you might need to consider potential issues like rounding errors when computing powers, especially with large exponents or fractional bases. It also requires handling edge cases such as x = 1 (which is a power of n for any n) and dealing with negative numbers/negative powers in the context of real-world scenarios.

Solving this problem would involve implementing these concepts effectively, which is why it can be considered intermediate to advanced based on the complexity involved in ensuring accuracy and handling all edge cases.
