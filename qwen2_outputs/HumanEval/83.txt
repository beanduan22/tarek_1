The programming problem described above can be categorized as follows:

Difficulty: Easy-Medium

Required Programming Skills: Basic programming knowledge including understanding of functions, loops (specifically for mathematical problems), arithmetic operations and conditional statements.

Complexity: Low to Moderate

Explanation:
1. **Difficulty**: The task involves performing a simple calculation using basic arithmetic principles. It does not require advanced concepts or complex algorithms.
2. **Required Programming Skills**: The problem doesn't necessitate any advanced programming techniques beyond the basics of working with integers, loops and conditional statements. This makes it suitable for beginners who are learning to code in Python or similar languages that support these features easily.
3. **Complexity**: Calculating the number of n-digit numbers starting or ending with 1 involves understanding how digits behave in different positions within a number. It requires careful consideration but does not have recursive, nested loops or other complex constructs.

Given its simplicity and focus on basic mathematical concepts combined with straightforward programming techniques, this problem would be suitable for beginners looking to practice their coding skills while still providing enough challenge to enhance their understanding of loops and conditionals in a practical context.
