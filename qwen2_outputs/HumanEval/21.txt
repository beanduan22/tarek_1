The given programming problem can be categorized as:

**Category: Easy/Medium**

This categorization is justified for several reasons:

1. **Required Programming Skills:** The problem doesn't require advanced algorithms or complex data structures. It focuses mainly on understanding basic mathematical concepts like linear transformations and familiarity with list manipulation in Python.

2. **Difficulty Level:** The task revolves around sorting the numbers to identify minimum and maximum values, performing subtraction (to shift the smallest value to 0), and division (to scale all numbers between 0 and 1). These operations are straightforward and can be executed using basic programming constructs like for-loops or list comprehensions.

3. **Complexity:** The primary challenge in this problem is correctly applying the formula `scaled = (number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)` to each element of the input list. However, the core logic does not involve complex flow control structures or recursion; it's more about understanding how and when to apply mathematical transformations.

4. **Educational Value:** The problem offers a good learning experience for beginners in programming as it involves fundamental concepts like iteration, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

In summary, this question targets students who are starting to learn programming fundamentals with Python, and aims at enhancing their understanding of list manipulation and simple mathematical transformations within the context of computer science problems.
