The given programming problem can be categorized as follows:

**Difficulty Level**: Easy

- **Required Programming Skills**: Basic understanding of arithmetic operations (addition, comparison), familiarity with conditional statements (if-else), and knowledge of function definitions in Python.

- **Complexity**: Low

This problem doesn't involve complex data structures or advanced algorithms. It simply checks if the given lengths form a right angle triangle using the Pythagorean theorem. The logic is straightforward and can be solved using basic mathematical concepts.

To solve this problem:

1. Sort the sides of the triangle in ascending order.
2. Check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of squares of other two sides.
3. Return True or False based on the result of the check.

This approach ensures that we are only checking the condition for a right-angled triangle using the theorem \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), where 'c' is the longest side.
