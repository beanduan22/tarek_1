The given problem falls under the category of "Easy".

**Difficulty:**

1. The problem statement is clear and straightforward, requiring only basic understanding and familiarity with Python or any other programming language that supports string manipulation functions such as `replace()`.

2. It involves mapping integers to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols and concatenating them in a specific order based on the value of the number provided. This process does not require complex algorithms or data structures.

3. No advanced concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, or parallel computing are involved.

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **Basic Python skills:** Understanding how to perform string manipulation (like concatenation and substitution) is essential for this problem.
   
2. **Control flow:** The implementation requires conditional statements (if-elif-else) to determine which symbol(s) should be appended based on the integer input.

3. **Looping:** To cover all possible values from 1 to 1000, you might need nested loops or a loop that iterates over predefined chunks of numbers and their Roman numeral equivalents.

**Problem Complexity:**

The complexity is relatively low because:

1. The problem has limited inputs (values between 1-1000), which makes it more predictable compared to problems with open-ended ranges.
   
2. There are no nested or recursive logic, loops within loops, or complex mathematical operations that would increase the difficulty.

3. It requires a simple mapping structure of integers to Roman numerals and then forming the correct sequence from this map based on input.

In conclusion, due to its straightforward nature, basic requirements for programming skills, limited complexity in terms of looping and conditional statements, and well-defined problem boundaries, this task can be categorized as "Easy".
