The problem described above can be categorized as Easy/Medium. 

This falls under basic string manipulation problems in computer science or coding interviews where candidates are expected to know their way around strings and have a good understanding of algorithms.

Required Programming Skills:
1. Basic knowledge about Python programming language (for this specific case).
2. Understanding of string slicing which helps us reverse the original string.
3. The ability to compare two strings, one normal and another reversed.
4. Basic familiarity with using assertions in Python code to verify correctness.

Problem Complexity: 
The problem involves comparing an input string against its reverse, a process that has linear time complexity (O(n)), where n is the length of the string. So this isn't too complex from an algorithmic perspective but requires a bit of attention to detail when implementing it correctly to avoid errors like off-by-one mistakes in indexing.

The problem also doesn't require recursion or loops at deeper levels, just simple conditional statements and comparison logic which makes it relatively straightforward.

In summary, the problem requires basic programming skills that are typically taught early on in computer science education and is suitable for candidates with a solid grasp of fundamental concepts. It would be appropriate for an entry-level coding interview question.
