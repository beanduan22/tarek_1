Based on the given information about this problem, we can classify it as follows:

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

**Required Programming Skills**: This problem requires a good understanding of string manipulation, basic knowledge of stack data structure, and familiarity with parsing techniques in Python. Understanding how to iterate over strings, manage collections (like lists), and use loops or recursion is also beneficial.

**Complexity**: The problem involves processing multiple groups within the input string which are separated by spaces. For each group, we need to calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. This requires iterating through the string character by character while maintaining a stack-like behavior to track open parenthesis '(' and calculate their depth accordingly.

To approach this problem, you might consider:
1. Splitting the input string into groups using `split(' ')` method.
2. Processing each group separately by iterating over its characters.
3. Using two counters: one for tracking the current level of nesting (e.g., counter) and another to store the maximum depth found so far in that particular group (e.g., max_depth).
4. Pushing open parentheses '(' onto a temporary stack or simply increasing `counter` when you encounter them.
5. Decreasing `counter` and updating `max_depth` whenever you encounter a closing parenthesis ')' until it returns to zero, which means reaching the end of a nested level.

This problem would be classified as intermediate because it requires logical thinking about how to process strings and maintain state through multiple levels of nested structures using techniques like iteration or recursion. The required skills include familiarity with Python syntax for manipulating lists, handling string data, and applying basic algorithmic concepts such as stack operations in the context of parsing expressions.

Solving this problem effectively will demonstrate proficiency in dealing with string-based inputs that involve hierarchical/grouped structures while utilizing appropriate programming constructs (like loops or recursive methods) to efficiently calculate required outputs.
