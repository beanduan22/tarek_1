The given problem is a classic example of a string processing question that involves understanding regular patterns within text data. The key points to consider are:

1. **Search for vowels**: This requires knowledge about strings and searching techniques in Python (or any language). 

2. **Consecutive consonants**: This involves iterating over the characters in reverse order from right to left, which is another common technique seen in string problems.

3. **Boundary conditions**: Special cases like "ab" need to be handled carefully since there are no vowels between two consonants at either ends.

The overall complexity of this problem can be considered as **Easy-Medium** due to the nature of tasks involved being straightforward and requiring basic programming skills:

- It requires string processing abilities which is usually taught early on in most coding languages.
  
- The task doesn't involve complex algorithms like sorting, searching over large datasets or recursion that could make the question more difficult.

In summary, this problem tests the understanding of strings and iterative techniques without delving into advanced or complicated programming concepts. Hence it falls under Easy-Medium difficulty category based on the skills required to solve it.
