The programming problem described above can be categorized as follows:

Category: Algorithm & Recursion

Explanation:
- Difficulty: The task involves understanding a new sequence (Tribonacci), applying recursion logic to calculate individual terms, and concatenating these terms into a list. This requires basic knowledge of algorithms and familiarity with recursive functions.
  
- Required Programming Skills: 
  - Familiarity with defining custom sequences or series using recursion.
  - Ability to handle conditional logic inside the function (determining if `n` is even or odd).
  - Working with lists in Python, specifically appending elements to a list.

- Complexity:
  - The complexity mainly lies in managing two different computation rules based on whether `n` is even or odd. This requires careful coding and understanding of how recursive calls unfold.
  - Managing the output as a list involves additional steps beyond simple computation (storing results into a list).
  
Overall, this problem targets intermediate-level skills in programming and algorithm design. It demands both logical reasoning to tackle different cases based on input values and practical implementation using Python's list structure along with recursion.

The focus is on understanding new sequences, applying recursive logic correctly, managing conditional scenarios, and outputting results as a structured data type (in this case, a list).
