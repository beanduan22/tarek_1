The problem described can be categorized as a "medium" level challenge for several reasons:

**Difficulty Level:**

- **Conceptual Understanding:** While it involves the Collatz conjecture (a well-known mathematical concept), understanding the basic idea of generating odd numbers in the sequence isn't too complex. The problem itself is not particularly demanding from an algorithmic complexity standpoint.
  
- **Implementation Complexity:** Implementing this problem requires knowledge of loops, conditionals, and list operations which are fundamental programming skills. However, it does not involve any advanced data structures or algorithms that are typically needed for more complex problems.

**Required Programming Skills:**

- **Basic to Intermediate Python Knowledge:** The solution involves using basic control flow statements (loops and conditionals) as well as some list manipulation techniques in Python.
  
- **Understanding of Algorithms:** Familiarity with the Collatz sequence would help in understanding how to generate it, but this knowledge isn't essential if they are following a step-by-step approach.

**Problem Complexity:**

- **Input Size:** The problem does not specify any constraints on input size. However, since we're dealing with an integer input, we can assume that the maximum possible value for `n` is limited by Python's integer type capacity (which is typically very large).

- **Efficiency Considerations:** The primary concern would be performance efficiency rather than space complexity, as the list of odd numbers generated will likely not exceed reasonable sizes.

Taking all these factors into account, this problem could be classified as a medium difficulty challenge, requiring a good understanding of basic programming concepts and the ability to apply them to solve a mathematical sequence problem.
