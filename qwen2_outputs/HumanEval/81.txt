Based on the given information about this programming problem, we can categorize it as follows:

**Difficulty:**
Intermediate to Advanced. The problem requires understanding of conditional statements (if-elif-else) along with basic data handling like list manipulation in Python. It also involves logical reasoning for mapping numerical grades to letter grades based on certain conditions.

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Conditional Logic:** Writing and utilizing if, elif, else statements to handle different cases based on grade ranges.
2. **List Manipulation:** Processing multiple inputs (grades) in a list format to return an output of the same length with corresponding letter grades.

**Complexity:**
The complexity arises from handling numerous possible input values within certain ranges for each letter grade and ensuring accurate mapping according to the grading system provided. This requires clear thought process or implementation through well-structured code.

In conclusion, this problem would suit someone who has a good grasp of basic Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and list handling. It could be used as an exercise in understanding complex if-elif-else logic structures for different cases, and testing the boundaries of such conditions with various input data points to ensure correctness.
