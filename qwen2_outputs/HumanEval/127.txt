The problem described above falls under the category of **Medium** difficulty level. The primary factors that contribute to this categorization are:

1. **Required Programming Skills**: This task requires knowledge in Python programming language specifically dealing with `if` conditionals, loops (`for`, `while`), and functions. No advanced data structures or algorithms beyond basic operations (like checking if a number is prime) are required.

2. **Complexity**: The complexity of the problem can be broken down into several steps:
   - Extracting intervals from the given input.
   - Calculating the intersection between two intervals, which involves finding overlapping range if they exist.
   - Determining the length of this overlap.
   - Implementing a function to check whether a number is prime (assuming this might need to be implemented as part of the solution).
   - Returning "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions mentioned in the problem description.

3. **Time and Space Complexity**: The primary bottleneck here would likely be calculating the intersection length, which could potentially involve nested loops if not optimized. However, since we're dealing with a relatively simple range calculation between two intervals, the time complexity is generally O(1) assuming no additional constraints on input size. The space complexity might be low as it involves storing only integer values.

To solve this problem effectively:
- **Algorithm Design**: Determine how to find overlapping intervals by comparing start and end points of each interval.
- **Prime Number Checking**: Develop a function that efficiently checks if the length calculated is prime, potentially using an iterative approach or checking divisibility up to square root of the number for optimization.
- **Return Logic**: Based on whether the intersection's length meets the problem criteria (prime length), return "YES" or "NO".

The solution would typically involve implementing these steps in a Python function that adheres to the guidelines provided.
