The problem described above is a relatively simple coding challenge that involves string processing and character manipulation. The main requirements are:

1. It tests basic understanding of strings in programming languages (accessing individual characters within a string).
2. Knowledge of ASCII values for specific characters (uppercase English alphabets specifically).
3. Basic arithmetic operations, like summing up elements.

The difficulty level is considered 'Easy' due to the straightforward nature and minimal complexity:

- It doesn't require advanced data structures or algorithms knowledge.
- The logic needed can be implemented using basic programming constructs such as loops or built-in functions available in many languages.

This problem primarily tests skills related to:
1. Basic understanding of strings
2. Familiarity with ASCII characters 
3. Ability to process and manipulate character data

In terms of complexity, this is a linear operation; each character needs to be processed once which makes it O(n), where n is the length of the string.

So in summary, this problem suits someone who's starting out learning programming or someone looking for easy practice problems on basic strings manipulation.
