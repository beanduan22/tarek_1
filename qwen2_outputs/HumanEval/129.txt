The problem presented involves a grid traversal with specific constraints which makes it quite interesting yet complex. 

**Category Predictions:**
1. **Difficulty:** Medium to High
2. **Required Programming Skills:** Understanding of graphs (for representing the grid), familiarity with path finding algorithms, knowledge of sorting and data structures (arrays, lists), understanding of recursion or iteration for traversal, having skills in implementing algorithms that find minimum/maximum values in a specific scenario.

**Justification:**
1. **Difficulty:** This problem is considered medium to high due to several reasons:
   - It requires algorithmic thinking about grid traversals which can be complex depending on the approach taken.
   - The requirement of finding a path with minimal value and considering lexicographic order adds another layer of complexity that deviates from simpler pathfinding problems like shortest path or minimum spanning tree problems.

2. **Required Programming Skills:** Solving this problem demands skills in several areas:
   - Graph understanding: A grid can be considered as an unweighted graph, where each cell is a node and adjacent cells are connected by edges.
   - Algorithmic Skills: You need to think about how you would traverse through the nodes (cells) of this 'graph' efficiently. Depth-first search (DFS), Breadth-first search (BFS), or even dynamic programming could be used depending on the solution approach.
   - Data Structures: Efficient storage for the grid and path information is crucial, possibly involving lists, arrays, hash tables, or other data structures that can facilitate quick lookups of paths and their values.

3. **Complexity:** The problem requires considering multiple aspects:
   - Choosing an efficient way to traverse the grid to find minimum paths.
   - Efficiently storing and comparing multiple potential paths for lexicographical comparison of results.
   - Finding a unique solution under the constraint that every integer in the range [1, N * N] appears exactly once on cells of the grid.

In conclusion, this problem requires significant skill in algorithms and data structures to design an effective solution. The complexity comes from managing multiple constraints (grid traversal rules, minimum path definition based on lexicographical order) simultaneously while ensuring optimal time/space usage.
