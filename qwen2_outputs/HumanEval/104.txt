This problem falls under a category of an Easy to Medium difficulty level depending upon the context. The reason being:

1) **Difficulty Level**: Solving this problem requires understanding basic concepts of list operations in Python and familiarity with iterating through elements of lists or arrays. Moreover, it needs to be able to understand digit extraction from numbers (which involves converting number into string format).

2) **Required Programming Skills**: Basic programming skills are enough for solving this problem including knowledge about loops, conditional statements, and array/list handling.

3) **Complexity**: The time complexity will likely depend upon the size of the input list. If the list is large, we would need an efficient way to find even digits which could potentially involve iterating over all numbers in the list (possibly one number several times if it has many digits). The worst-case scenario might be O(n*m), where 'n' is the length of the input list and 'm' is the average length of the numbers in the list.

Thus, this problem tests skills in basic programming concepts but does not require advanced algorithms or data structures which makes it suitable for beginners/intermediate level programmers.
