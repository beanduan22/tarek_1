This problem can be categorized as an easy-level question. It requires basic understanding of Python programming language and familiarity with concepts like list manipulation and conditional statements.

To solve this problem:

1. **Function Signature**:
The function `below_threshold` accepts two parameters: a list (`l`) containing numerical values, and an integer threshold (`t`). The return type is boolean indicating if all elements in the list are below the given threshold or not.

2. **Algorithm**:
- Initialize a boolean variable (`all_below`) to keep track of whether all numbers in the list are below `t`. Set its initial value as True.
- Loop through each element (`num`) in the input list (`l`).
   - If at any point `num >= t`, set `all_below` to False and break out of the loop because we've found an element that doesn't meet the criteria. 
   - If the loop completes without setting `all_below` to False, it means all elements are below threshold.

3. **Return Statement**:
- Return the value of `all_below`. This will be True if all numbers in the list are below the threshold and False otherwise.

4. **Problem Analysis**:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input list (`l`). It iterates through each element once. The space complexity is constant as it doesn't require additional space proportional to the input size.

In summary, this problem assesses fundamental programming skills like iterating over a list and making decisions based on conditions being met or not, which are part of basic algorithmic thinking in computer science.
