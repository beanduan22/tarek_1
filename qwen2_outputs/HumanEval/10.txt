The given problem falls under the category of "Intermediate" level in terms of difficulty. It requires a certain understanding of string manipulation, iteration and algorithmic thinking.

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **String Manipulation**: The program involves operations like slicing (`[::-1]`) which is used for reversing strings.
2. **Looping Mechanisms**: Iterating over the string to find palindromes would require looping through parts of the given string, which might include nested loops or simple iterations.
3. **Algorithmic Thinking**: The problem requires an understanding of how to identify a palindrome and construct a logic that finds the longest palindromic suffix in the input string and computes the reverse prefix needed for making it a full palindrome.

**Complexity:**

1. **Time Complexity**: For finding if a string is palindrome (`is_palindrome` function), the complexity would be O(n) as we are iterating through half of the string length to check equality with its reversed counterpart.
2. **Space Complexity**: Both functions might have constant space complexity assuming that the internal storage of Python strings does not change significantly based on input size.

This problem is suitable for candidates who are familiar with basic string operations and can apply algorithmic logic effectively to solve a problem involving strings, palindromes, and reversals. It requires careful implementation considering edge cases (like empty string), but overall the solution should be straightforward once understood conceptually.
