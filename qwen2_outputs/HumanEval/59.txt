The problem mentioned above is categorized under **Intermediate Level**. Here's why:

### Difficulty:
1. **Algorithmic Thinking:** Finding prime factors of a number requires understanding of fundamental concepts like division and iteration. The algorithm needs to efficiently find the largest prime factor by testing divisibility up to the square root of `n`. This shows that problem-solving skills are required, making it slightly challenging for beginners.

2. **Mathematical Knowledge:** While not as complex as problems involving advanced mathematical theories, this problem necessitates knowledge about prime numbers and basic arithmetic operations, which is a fundamental part of programming but might be new or rusty to some learners.

### Required Programming Skills:
- **Looping Constructs:** The solution will likely involve loops (most probably `for` and `while`) for iterating through possible factors.
- **Conditional Statements:** To check divisibility or whether a number is prime, conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`) becomes crucial.

### Complexity:
1. **Time Complexity:** An efficient algorithm should have good time complexity to solve the problem effectively for larger inputs. The proposed solution aims to iterate up to the square root of `n`, making it relatively more efficient compared to brute-force methods which might require iterating through all numbers less than `n`.

2. **Space Complexity:** This is not a space-intensive problem as it primarily involves manipulating basic data types and variables.

### Educational Value:
This problem helps reinforce concepts related to loops, conditionals, arithmetic operations, and the use of efficient algorithms for problem-solvingâ€”a good mix for intermediate learners looking to deepen their understanding while practicing important programming skills.
