The given programming problem is quite basic in terms of difficulty but requires understanding of several key concepts related to programming. Based on the following aspects:

1. **Conceptual Complexity**: The concept being used here is factorial calculation, which involves simple mathematical operations like multiplication. This part is relatively straightforward.

2. **Algorithmic Skills**: No advanced algorithms or data structures are required for this problem, just basic understanding of loops and arithmetic operations in programming languages.

3. **Problem-Specific Complexity**:
   - The loop has to go backward from `n` to `1`, calculating `(i-1)!` each time.
   - Multiplication is a key operation throughout the process.
   
4. **Error Handling**: No explicit error handling is mentioned, but in practice, you might want to handle cases where inputs are less than 0 or non-integer values.

5. **Memory Usage**: The function does not seem to require significant memory usage as it involves calculations only and doesn't store any large data structures.

6. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n)`, since we're running a loop from `n` down to `1`. 

Based on these considerations, this problem could be categorized under:
- **Beginner/Intermediate Level**: Because it requires understanding of basic programming constructs (like loops and arithmetic operations), yet avoids complex algorithms or data structures.
- **Skill Requirements**: It tests the ability to manipulate numerical values in a loop and understand recursive nature of factorial calculation without explicitly defining recursion.

Overall, this problem does not fall under advanced difficulty levels as there are no optimization issues, concurrency problems, large input sizes, or complex algorithmic concepts needed. It's more about translating an algorithm into code efficiently and correctly implementing the required logic based on the provided specifications.
