The given problem falls under the "Easy" to "Medium" level depending on one's familiarity with Python data structures. This is because it requires an understanding of basic programming concepts like list manipulation and dictionary operations.

### Skills Required:

1. **Basic Python Programming**: The ability to work with lists, use for loops, conditionals (`if` statements), and arithmetic operations are required.
2. **Dictionary Usage**: Using dictionaries in Python can help count the frequency of each element in a list efficiently.
3. **List Slicing and Indexing**: Basic knowledge to access and manipulate elements within the list.

### Problem Complexity:

1. **Data Structure Management**: The primary complexity lies in managing data through dictionaries where keys are unique integers from the input list, and values represent their counts.
2. **Algorithm Logic**: Determining if a value exists that meets certain conditions requires clear logic and careful comparison against each integer's value and its frequency.

### Algorithmic Steps:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each number appears in the given list `lst`.
2. **Iterate Through Counted Values**: Loop through the dictionary keys, which are integers from the original list.
3. **Check Criteria**: For each key, check if its value (count) is greater than or equal to itself.
4. **Return Maximum Value**: Keep track of the maximum integer that satisfies the condition during iteration and return it at the end.

### Conclusion:

Given the simplicity of iterating through a dictionary with an easily understandable task (finding integers whose frequency matches or exceeds their value), this problem would be considered "Easy" for intermediate Python programmers familiar with basic data structures. However, it could become "Medium" to some if they are not used to efficiently working with dictionaries or managing conditional logic within loops.
