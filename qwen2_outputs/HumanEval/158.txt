The problem presented here can be categorized as an intermediate-level question in Python programming. It assesses several key skills:

1. **Understanding of List and String Data Structures**: You need to work with strings inside a list format.

2. **Algorithms**: The requirement involves finding unique characters within each string, which may involve character counting or set usage. This is essentially an algorithmic task.

3. **Comparison Logic**: Sorting the words based on lexicographical order for situations where multiple solutions have equal unique characters count.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The problem includes edge cases like returning "" if all strings are of the same length, or handling when there's no string in a list etc., which tests understanding and preparation for such contingencies.

5. **Understanding Python Function Parameters**: The function `find_max` is expected to take an input argument as a single parameter: a list of strings.

6. **Return Type and Structure**: The output needs to be the word that meets the criteria described in the problem, which involves data manipulation and potentially comparison operations.

Overall, this question combines string and list handling skills with basic algorithmic concepts like sorting for intermediate level programmers aiming to strengthen their proficiency in Python or similar programming languages.
