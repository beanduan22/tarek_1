The given programming problem falls under the category of "Easy" due to several factors:

1. **Skill Level**: It requires knowledge of basic Python programming concepts such as list manipulation (iterating over a list), conditional checks (`if` statements), arithmetic operations, and function definition.

2. **Problem Complexity**: The problem is straightforward; it involves iterating through the elements in the list, checking their conditions (odd numbers, non-negative integers, non-zero values) and calculating their squares' sum. There are no complex algorithms or data structures involved.

3. **Time and Space Complexity**: The solution would likely have a time complexity of O(n), as it iterates over each element once in the input list. The space complexity is also relatively low as it does not require any additional data structures that scale with the size of the input beyond a constant number of variables.

In summary, this problem targets the foundational skills required for understanding basic programming concepts and algorithmic thinking without introducing advanced topics or complex logic. It would be suitable for beginners in Python development or anyone needing to refresh their fundamentals in coding basics.
