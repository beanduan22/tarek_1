The given programming problem is categorized as Easy. This classification is due to the following factors:

**Difficulty:**
The task involves performing a common operation in data processing - sorting unique elements from a list. The problem statement itself does not require advanced knowledge or complex algorithms; instead, it focuses on applying basic concepts of Python programming.

**Required Programming Skills:**
To solve this problem, one needs to have familiarity with the following skills:
1. Basic syntax and constructs (e.g., lists, loops)
2. Using built-in functions in Python
3. Data manipulation and sorting

This does not require knowledge of complex programming techniques or advanced libraries.

**Complexity:**
The operation required here is quite straightforward - finding unique elements in a list and then sorting them. The solution can be implemented using simple steps that are easily understandable even for beginners:

1. Using the set() function to eliminate duplicate values (since sets contain only unique elements).
2. Converting the resulting set back into a list.
3. Sorting the list using Python's built-in sort() method or sorted() function.

Overall, this problem tests fundamental programming skills without delving into complexity that might be found in problems requiring algorithms like recursion, dynamic programming, graph theory, etc., making it an appropriate Easy-level problem for beginners or as part of a curriculum that introduces students to basic data structures and manipulation.
