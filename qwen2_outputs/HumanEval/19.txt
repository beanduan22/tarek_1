The programming problem described can be categorized as follows:

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

- The task requires understanding of string manipulation, regular expressions (or dictionary lookup), sorting algorithms, and working with string inputs. These are concepts typically covered in an intermediate to advanced level of programming education.

**Required Programming Skills**:
1. **String Manipulation**: Working with strings is essential for this problem as it involves splitting the input into individual number words, which may need further processing.
2. **Data Types**: The program deals with various data types including string and possibly integers after converting word-number pairs.
3. **Dictionary Usage**: Using a dictionary to map number words to their corresponding integer values facilitates easier sorting.
4. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementing or using a built-in sort function to order the numbers from smallest to largest.

**Complexity**:
1. **Conversion Process**: The challenge lies in converting string representations of numbers ('zero', 'one') to integers for comparison during sorting.
2. **Mapping and Reversing**: Mapping number words to integers, performing sorting, and then reversing back to word format requires careful handling to maintain the correct sequence after conversion.

Overall, this problem tests intermediate-level programming skills related to data types manipulation, string processing, and basic algorithms like sorting in a practical context. It's slightly complex due to the multi-step process involved in number-word translation but remains within the realm of approachable challenges for someone with intermediate programming proficiency.
