The given programming problem falls under a 'Beginner to Intermediate' level category in terms of difficulty. The problem involves basic operations like list handling, mathematical calculations (squaring numbers and rounding them), and understanding Python's built-in functions.

Required Programming Skills:
1. Knowledge of Lists: The candidate should know how to work with lists including the ability to access elements and iterate through the list.
2. Basic Mathematical Functions: Understanding of squaring a number and using the ceiling function is required, which can be achieved using the `math.ceil()` function from Python's math module.
3. Type Conversion: Experience in converting floating-point numbers to integers by using appropriate type conversion functions like `int()`, or directly utilizing floor division (`//`) for integer operations.

Problem Complexity:
1. Input Handling: The problem involves processing multiple elements (numbers) that can be either integers or floats, which adds some complexity to the code.
2. Logic Implementation: The main challenge lies in correctly implementing the logic that includes both squaring and ceiling/rounding off operations on each element of the list, then summing up these values.

In summary, while the concept of solving this problem might not be very complex for experienced programmers, it could pose some challenges to beginners due to its multi-step nature involving basic arithmetic operations, type conversion, and list handling. However, with proper guidance and understanding of Python's built-in functions, the problem can be easily solved by students learning programming basics or those at an intermediate level looking to refine their skills in specific areas.
