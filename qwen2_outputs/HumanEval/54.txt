The given problem can be categorized as a **Medium** level question. The primary focus of this problem is on data manipulation, string comparison, and basic programming concepts.

### Required Programming Skills:
1. **String Manipulation**: Understanding how to work with strings in Python and extracting necessary information from them.
2. **Character Counting**: Ability to count occurrences of each character in a string using collections or by manually iterating over the string.
3. **Comparison**: Comparing two sets of data, which might involve sorting arrays, dictionaries, or lists representing characters.

### Problem Complexity:
The problem involves comparing two strings based on their unique characters while considering frequency (number of occurrences). The logic is straightforward and does not involve deep algorithmic complexity or advanced data structures.

In summary, the problem requires a solid understanding of string handling in Python and the ability to compare frequencies of characters across two given strings. No external libraries are required besides what comes built-in with Python. Solving this problem would help reinforce basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and comparison operators.
