The given programming problem can be categorized as an **Easy** level task, requiring basic understanding of Python's built-in data structures and operations. It combines concepts from mathematics (multiplication, absolute values, and summing) with programming logic.

### Difficulty:
- **Conceptual**: The problem involves fundamental arithmetic operations like multiplication and summation.
- **Implementation**: Requires handling different scenarios such as empty arrays or negative numbers efficiently without causing errors in the code.

### Required Programming Skills:
1. **Array manipulation**: Understanding how to iterate over array elements using for loops or list comprehensions.
2. **Conditional logic**: Implementing if statements to handle edge cases like an empty input array, zero values which are neutral when multiplied by any number's sign, and negative numbers whose sign contributes to the final product.

### Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: The algorithm iterates through each element in the array once, resulting in a linear time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space complexity**: Uses constant space as it does not require any additional data structures that scale with input size; thus, it's also O(1).

This problem assesses basic programming skills and understanding of algorithmic concepts without delving into advanced topics such as recursion or complex data structures.
