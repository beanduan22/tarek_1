The given programming problem involves understanding list indexing, conditions for elements (even numbers), and performing arithmetic operations. The primary focus is on manipulating data within a list structure in Python.

**Difficulty Level: Easy**

- **Required Programming Skills**: 
   - Basic knowledge of the Python programming language including familiarity with loops (`for` loop), conditional statements (`if` statement), indexing in lists, and basic arithmetic operations.
   
- **Problem Complexity**: 
   - The problem deals directly with a list containing integers. No external libraries are required, thus the complexity is low in terms of dependencies.
   - The operations performed involve simple mathematical conditions applied to elements at odd indices within the list, which can be executed relatively straightforwardly.

Based on these factors, I would categorize this problem as **Easy**. It requires basic programming skills and familiarity with Python's data structures specifically lists. Students learning fundamental programming concepts should be able to understand and solve this problem without difficulty.
