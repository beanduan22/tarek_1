The given programming problem can be categorized as Easy-Medium in terms of difficulty level. It requires basic understanding of string manipulation and working with numerical values in programming.

To solve this problem, one needs to:

1. Parse the input value from a string into a number (float or integer) which might involve considering the presence of decimal points or other non-numeric characters.
2. Determine if rounding up or down is needed based on the decimal part of the number.
3. Implement logic for rounding away from zero when two possible values are equidistant from the given number.

The problem requires knowledge and application of basic programming constructs such as variables, conditionals (if-else), arithmetic operations, type conversions, and string manipulation.

In summary, this problem tests skills in handling data types conversion, conditional execution based on numeric evaluation, and logic for specific rounding rules.
