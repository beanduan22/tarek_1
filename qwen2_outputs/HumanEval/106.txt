This problem can be categorized as an Easy-Medium level programming question. The reason behind this categorization is:

**Difficulty:** The problem requires basic understanding of programming concepts like loops, functions (factorial calculation), and array manipulation. It doesn't involve complex algorithms or data structures.

**Required Programming Skills:** This question tests skills such as defining a function (`f(n)`), using loops (for iterating over `i` from 1 to `n`), handling conditional logic (if `i` is even vs if it's not), and calculating the factorial of a number. These are foundational programming concepts that most beginners are familiar with.

**Complexity:** The complexity here comes primarily from managing two different calculations based on whether `i` is even or odd, which involves creating two different computation paths within the loop (one for factorial calculation when `i` is even and another for sum of numbers up to `i` otherwise). This necessitates careful structuring of code logic but does not involve any deep, complex algorithms that scale poorly with larger inputs.

Therefore, the problem balances simplicity in concept while requiring enough detail in implementation to ensure students or candidates show a grasp of basic programming techniques.
