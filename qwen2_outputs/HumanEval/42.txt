This problem falls under the category of "Easy" programming questions. It requires basic knowledge in Python programming such as understanding list data structure and being able to perform arithmetic operations on integers.

The solution involves iterating through each element of a given list, incrementing its value by 1, and storing the updated values back into the original list. This task is straightforward and doesn't involve complex algorithms or data structures which makes it easy for beginners in programming.

Moreover, this question also tests fundamental problem-solving skills like identifying patterns (how to apply an operation on each element of a collection) and using proper syntax in Python to accomplish that.

The overall complexity here is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. Each element needs to be processed once which makes it linear time complexity, easy to understand and implement by most beginners or those who are learning programming languages like Python.
