This problem can be categorized under Basic Algorithms or Fundamentals in terms of difficulty level. The following points indicate why:

**Required Programming Skills:** The solution requires knowledge about basic string manipulation in a programming language such as Python. Specifically, it involves extracting words from a sentence (splitting the string by spaces), determining if a number is prime (which can be achieved using simple algorithms like checking for divisibility up to square root of the number), and then collecting those words whose length corresponds to a prime number.

**Complexity:** The problem doesn't involve complex data structures or advanced algorithmic concepts. It's mainly about iterating over strings, performing arithmetic operations on numbers, and conditional checks based on those operations (determining whether a word length is a prime number).

**Time Complexity:** Since the main operations are string splitting (O(n) complexity where n is the number of words in the sentence), checking each length for primality (O(sqrt(k)) for each k-word, which sums up to O(n*sqrt(max_word_length)), and collecting the results. However, given that max_word_length doesn't exceed 100 based on constraints, we can approximate this as linear complexity relative to word count.

**Space Complexity:** The space complexity is mainly due to storing the output (the words themselves) and potentially a few counters for counting lengths or primes if you choose an approach that requires those. Assuming that the storage of individual strings doesn't scale significantly with input size, we can estimate this as O(n), where n is the number of words.

Therefore, considering these aspects—required skills, complexity level, and time/space considerations—the problem falls under Basic Algorithms or Fundamentals in terms of programming education categories.
