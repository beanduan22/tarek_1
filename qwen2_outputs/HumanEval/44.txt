The problem falls under the "Easy" difficulty level. It requires basic knowledge of algorithms related to number base conversion.

Required Programming Skills:

1. Understanding of how different numerical bases work (in this case, binary, ternary etc.).
2. Ability to handle string manipulations as the output will be in string format.
3. Good programming practices like documenting code, handling edge cases (like negative numbers), and checking inputs for validity.

Complexity: The algorithm used is quite straightforward - it involves repeatedly dividing the number by the new base and collecting remainders until reaching zero. This process of division and remainder calculation doesn't involve complex data structures or advanced algorithms. However, as the problem states that bases are less than 10, this makes implementation relatively simple without the need for complex condition checking in the algorithm.

The problem also encourages understanding and practical application of number theory concepts which could be beneficial for further learning in computer science, mathematics, and cryptography fields.
