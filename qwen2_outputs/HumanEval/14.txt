The given problem can be categorized as an Easy-level question, requiring fundamental knowledge of string manipulation and basic Python programming skills.

**Difficulty:**

- **Beginner to Intermediate:** The task involves processing strings and understanding list operations in Python. There are no advanced data structures or complex algorithms required for solving this problem.
  
**Required Programming Skills:**
- Basic proficiency in Python:
  - Understanding of lists
  - Ability to iterate over a string and extract substrings
  
**Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
    - Looping through the string to generate prefixes takes linear time proportional to the length of the input string. For each position in the string, we generate n-i strings where i is the current index (as we are including that character). Hence, this sums up to approximately n^2 for an average case.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
    - The list returned from the function grows linearly with respect to the length of the input string.

**Solving Approach:**
To solve this problem efficiently, one can follow these steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `prefixes` to store all prefixes.
2. Iterate over each character in the given string by using a for loop and include it into new strings to form prefix (starting from the first character).
3. Append each newly formed prefix into the `prefixes` list.
4. Return the `prefixes` list when the iteration is completed.

Here's how you might write this function:

```python
def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    prefixes = []
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # slice the string from start to current index + 1 to get prefix
        prefix = string[:i+1]
        prefixes.append(prefix)
    
    return prefixes
```

The above function works perfectly fine for generating all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string as per the problem statement.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to nested operations within the loop, and space complexity of O(n), which is sufficient for handling most practical cases.
