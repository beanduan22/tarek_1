The programming problem described above can be categorized as an easy-level problem. The reason for this categorization is that it requires basic understanding of arrays, integers, loops, arithmetic operations (addition) and conditional statements in a programming language.

Required Programming Skills:
- Basic usage of functions
- Ability to manipulate array elements
- Understanding of conditions (if-else statement)
- Familiarity with loops (for loop)

Problem Complexity:
The complexity of this problem is low. The logic revolves around iterating over each element in the array, calculating the sum of its digits and checking if the sum is greater than zero.

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space proportional to the input size is required. 

The problem does not involve any advanced data structures or complex algorithms, making it suitable for beginners who are learning programming basics and improving their ability to handle arrays and loops.
