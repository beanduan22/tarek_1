This problem can be categorized under several categories depending on certain criteria:

### Difficulty Level:
- **Easy**: Given that this problem involves basic list comprehension or filtering techniques in Python, it is relatively easy for beginners who are familiar with the language. The concept of using a function to filter elements based on conditions (here: positive numbers) is straightforward.

### Required Programming Skills:
- **Basic Python**: This problem assumes familiarity with Python basics such as working with lists and conditional statements.
  - **List Operations**: Understanding how to iterate over elements in a list (`for loop`) and modifying or returning elements from a list based on conditions (`if statement`).
- **Conditional Logic**: The use of `if` statement to evaluate whether an element is positive (greater than zero).

### Complexity:
- **Time and Space Efficiency**:
  - **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this function is linear, O(n), as it iterates over the list once. Here `n` is the number of elements in the input list.
  - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is constant (O(1)), assuming we are not counting the output list towards our complexity since it's a requirement to return an updated version of the list based on the condition, and hence doesn't add any significant extra space usage over the initial list.

### Algorithmic Approach:
This problem primarily requires a clear understanding of conditional statements in Python. The solution involves iterating through each element in the given list (`l`), checking if it's positive using an `if` statement, and then adding those elements to a new list that gets returned at the end of the function.

Overall, this programming problem is suitable for beginners or as a quick exercise to reinforce understanding of basic Python concepts like loops, conditional statements, and list manipulation. It doesn't require complex data structures, recursion, or advanced algorithms, making it an ideal starting point for learning fundamental programming skills in Python.
