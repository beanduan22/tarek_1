The given problem involves basic concepts of programming like list manipulation, conditional checks, and loop usage. The primary task is to verify whether a list of integers is sorted in ascending order without any duplicates exceeding one.

To solve this problem effectively, you need to understand:

1. **List Slicing**: Comparing adjacent elements or slicing lists.
2. **Loop Control Structures**: Utilizing `for` loops and/or `while` loops for iterating through the list.
3. **Conditionals**: Using if statements to check certain conditions such as checking duplicates exceeding one and verifying ascending order.

The problem doesn't involve complex data structures like trees, graphs or algorithms that require recursion or advanced sorting techniques. Hence, it leans more towards **Beginner** level problems requiring basic programming skills and understanding of iteration and conditional logic in the context of list manipulation. The complexity is low due to straightforward checks being sufficient to determine the solution without requiring sophisticated algorithmic approaches.

Therefore, categorizing this problem:
- Difficulty: Beginner
- Required Programming Skills: Basic List Manipulation & Conditional Logic
- Complexity: Low

This indicates that it would be suitable for learners familiar with Python basics looking to practice and reinforce their understanding of fundamental programming concepts.
