The given programming problem seems to fall under the categories of Easy/Medium in terms of difficulty. The task requires understanding of basic string manipulation and conditional logic.

Required Programming Skills:
1. String handling: This includes splitting strings into substrings, joining substrings into a single string using different separators, and iterating over the characters or substrings within the original string.
2. Conditional Logic: Since the problem has conditions based on the number of consecutive spaces, this would require checking for specific patterns (sequences) within the string.

Complexity:
- Time Complexity: The algorithm iterates through each character of the input string once, making it O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity will be minimal since we're only storing a few extra variables. Therefore, it can also be considered constant or linear depending on how you count auxiliary space.

To solve this problem, you might need to:

1. Iterate through each character (or substring if considering consecutive spaces) in the input string.
2. Check for consecutive spaces by checking if current char is " " and previous one was also a space (`" "`).
3. If less than 3 consecutive spaces are found, replace them with underscores ("_").
4. If more than or equal to 3 consecutive spaces are found, replace them with hyphens ("-").
