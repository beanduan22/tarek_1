The provided Python code is a simple function that checks if the last character of a given string falls into certain criteria:

1. It must be an alphabetical letter (A-Z or a-z).
2. The letter should not be part of a word; it means there shouldn't be any space (" ") before this last character.

Based on difficulty, required programming skills, and complexity:

**Difficulty:** Easy
- This problem involves basic Python concepts like string manipulation and conditional logic.
- It doesn't require any advanced libraries or complex algorithms.

**Required Programming Skills:**
- **String manipulation**: The function deals with extracting characters from the end of a string. To achieve this, you can use indexing operations in Python (e.g., `string[-1]`).
- **Conditional checks**: You'll need to implement conditions to check if the character is an alphabetical letter and that it doesn't have any space before it.

**Complexity:**
- The function would likely involve a single loop or direct computation using built-in string methods in Python, which makes its time complexity O(n) where n is the length of the input string.
  
In summary, this problem falls into the category of "Easy" problems that require basic familiarity with strings and conditional logic. It tests skills like handling strings, applying conditions based on character properties (alphabetical vs. non-alphabetical), and understanding how to handle whitespace in text data.
