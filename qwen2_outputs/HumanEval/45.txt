The given programming problem can be classified as:

**Category: Beginner Level**
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Required Programming Skills:** Basic understanding of arithmetic operations (multiplication) and function definition in Python. No need for advanced data structures or algorithms.

- **Complexity:** Low

The problem involves calculating the area of a triangle using the formula:
Area = 0.5 * base * height.
This is a straightforward calculation that most beginners can handle after being introduced to basic programming concepts.

**Solution:**
Here's a simple solution for the provided function:

```python
def triangle_area(base, height):
    """Calculate and return the area of a triangle given its base length and height."""
    # Calculate the area using the formula 0.5 * base * height
    area = 0.5 * base * height
    
    # Return the calculated area
    return area


# Test the function with provided data point
print(triangle_area(5, 3))  # Expected output: 7.5
```
