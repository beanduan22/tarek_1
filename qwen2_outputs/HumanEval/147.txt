The problem described above can be categorized as follows:

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate

**Required Programming Skills**: 
- Understanding of basic data structures like lists or arrays
- Knowledge of arithmetic operations in programming languages (addition, multiplication)
- Basic understanding of loops and iteration
- Ability to apply mathematical concepts like finding square numbers and multiples 

**Complexity**: The solution involves:
1. Generating an array with a specific pattern based on the input `n`
2. Iterating through the array elements to form triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` where `i < j < k`
3. Checking if the sum of any such triple is divisible by 3

The solution requires careful handling of index-based iteration and mathematical computations, but does not involve advanced data structures or complex algorithms like recursion, sorting, graph theory, etc. 

Therefore, this problem can be considered to have an intermediate difficulty level that tests basic programming skills with a hint of math operations involved.
