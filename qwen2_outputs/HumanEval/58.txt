The provided programming problem is relatively straightforward and focuses primarily on implementing a function that finds common elements between two given lists. The task involves basic list operations like sorting, comparing, and handling duplicates.

**Difficulty Level**: Easy

**Required Programming Skills**: This problem requires knowledge of Python basics such as defining functions, working with lists, sorting, and handling duplicate values in lists. It also emphasizes on understanding input/output parameters correctly using type annotations (`def common(l1: list, l2: list)`).

**Complexity**: The complexity of this task is low because it mainly involves direct implementation of the specified functionality without needing advanced data structures or complex algorithms.

To solve the problem, you would typically:
1. Combine both lists into one.
2. Sort the combined list (to simplify finding duplicates).
3. Iterate through the sorted list to find duplicate elements which are common in both original lists.
4. Return unique common elements as specified in the function docstring.

The solution will involve some form of iteration, list handling, and potential use of built-in Python functions for sorting and removing duplicates (like `set()` or `.unique()` method if available).
