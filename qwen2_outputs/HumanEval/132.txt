The given programming problem can be classified as easy to medium level in terms of difficulty. It requires basic understanding of string manipulation and control flow in a programming language.

Here are the key aspects that make up this classification:

1. **Required Programming Skills**: The solution needs familiarity with handling strings, using loops or conditionals (to check subsequences), and nested structures like arrays/lists/stacks for managing and checking the sequence of brackets.

2. **Complexity**:
   - **Algorithmic Complexity**: The primary algorithm used in this problem is to iterate through each character of the input string once (linear time complexity, O(n)), making it efficient.
   - **Space Complexity**: Minimal space usage is required as the program only needs a few variables for storing indices or temporary results, hence also linear (O(1) or constant).

3. **Problem Difficulty Level**: The logic involves simple concepts like identifying subsequences and nested structures, which can be challenging for beginners but straightforward to understand and implement.

In summary, this problem falls into the category of an easy-moderate difficulty level requiring fundamental programming skills without any complex data structures or algorithms that need advanced knowledge to solve.
