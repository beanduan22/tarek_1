Based on the description provided, this problem involves string parsing, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic. Let's break down the aspects:

1. **String Parsing**: The function needs to interpret fractions represented as strings into numerical values (numerator and denominator). This requires understanding of string manipulation techniques like splitting a string at a specific character.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**: The core functionality involves performing multiplication between two fractions, simplifying the result if possible, and checking whether it is a whole number. Calculating with fractions involves finding the least common multiple (LCM), multiplying numerators and denominators respectively, and potentially reducing the fraction to its simplest form.

3. **Conditional Logic**: This revolves around determining if the final output of x * n results in an integer or not. You'll need logic that can handle this determination accurately, which could involve working with modular arithmetic and understanding when a given number is divisible without remainder.

In terms of difficulty:
- **Intermediate to Advanced**: The problem requires knowledge of basic arithmetic operations on fractions as well as handling string manipulations. These skills are expected from an intermediate level programmer but might also challenge someone who is more familiar with programming logic than mathematical concepts.
  
In terms of required programming skills: 
- **String and Data Manipulation Skills**: Ability to parse strings into numeric values, understand how to split strings on delimiters such as slashes '/', and process numerical information accordingly. 

Regarding complexity:
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: The main challenge here is the arithmetic operations involved in multiplying fractions and reducing them to their simplest form which could be considered O(1) for fixed size inputs (assuming standard integer values).
  
Thus, this problem might fall into a category of "Intermediate" difficulty requiring skills like string processing, basic mathematical operations, logical conditions, and possibly some algorithmic understanding.
