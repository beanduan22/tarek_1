The given problem is an example of an algorithmic or logic-based programming task. Here's why:

**Difficulty Level:** Easy to medium

- **Required Programming Skills:**
  - Basic understanding of numbers and arithmetic operations (summing digits).
  - Ability to manipulate the binary representation of a number.
- **Complexity:**
  - The problem involves basic iteration through each digit, which is straightforward and doesn't require complex data structures or algorithms.

The main challenge lies in translating the sum into its binary form, but this can be handled using built-in functions and loops common to most programming languages. Thus, it requires understanding of core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, variables, and basic math operations, rather than advanced topics.

Overall, this problem could serve as a good exercise for beginners or those looking to practice their basic programming skills while reinforcing the concept of binary conversion and arithmetic operations on integers.
