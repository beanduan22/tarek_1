The given problem can be categorized as an intermediate level programming challenge. It requires understanding of string manipulation in Python, familiarity with the `ord()` function for character conversion, basic list handling capabilities, and knowledge about conditional statements to tackle different scenarios.

To solve this problem effectively:

1. **String Manipulation**: The problem demands working with strings by splitting them based on specific delimiters such as whitespace or commas.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Implementing logic to handle cases where there are no whitespaces or commas necessitates using conditional checks, specifically the `if` statement(s).
3. **Character Handling**: Utilizing Python's built-in character order conversion function (`ord()`) is essential for calculating a specific output when no whitespace or comma exists.

Overall, this problem tests one's ability to handle multiple conditions in their code and effectively manage string data types using basic programming constructs and functions provided by the language (Python).

The key aspects of solving this problem might involve writing logic that can:

- Detect if there is a whitespace or comma as a delimiter.
- Split the input string accordingly and return the resulting list.
- If no whitespaces or commas exist, count the number of lowercase letters with odd order in the alphabet.

Thus, it primarily tests skills related to these areas: string manipulation techniques, conditional logic, and character-based calculations in Python.
