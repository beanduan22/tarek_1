The problem described can be categorized as:

**Category: Easy**

- **Difficulty**: The task at hand involves string manipulation which is a fundamental skill in programming. No advanced algorithms or complex data structures are required, making this problem relatively simple to understand and implement.

- **Required Programming Skills**: This question focuses on basic string handling operations like iteration over strings, slicing, concatenation, and ordering characters based on ASCII values. It requires familiarity with these concepts but does not demand knowledge of more complex programming constructs or algorithms.

- **Complexity**: The logic behind the solution is straightforward and linear in nature, requiring just a few lines of code to iterate through each character in the input string, order it based on ASCII values, and then construct an output string accordingly. There are no loops within loops or recursive calls which would introduce higher complexity levels.

In summary, this problem can be solved using basic programming constructs, focusing mainly on string manipulation techniques. The solution does not require deep understanding of data structures or algorithms beyond the basics, making it suitable for beginners to intermediate level programmers looking to practice their skills in handling strings and character-based tasks.
