The provided problem falls into the following categories:

1. **Skill Level**: Intermediate

2. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - **List handling**: Ability to work with lists in Python, including iterating over elements and accessing their values.
   - **Mathematical Operations**: Understanding of basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, division, and absolute value computation.
   - **Function definition**: Knowledge on defining functions using Python syntax which includes specifying parameter types and return type.

3. **Complexity**:
   - This problem involves straightforward concepts but requires attention to detail in handling data and performing calculations based on a specific formula. There is no recursion or nested loops, making it relatively simple.
   - The computation of the mean absolute deviation essentially requires finding the average of the absolute differences between each element and the mean of the dataset.

In summary, this problem tests intermediate-level programming skills with an emphasis on data handling and arithmetic operations, and does not require advanced concepts like recursion or complex algorithms. It would be suitable for beginners looking to practice more involved tasks beyond basic operations in Python.
