The problem you've described is a classic example of an algorithmic challenge that combines several key concepts in computer science and coding:

1. **String Manipulation**: The task involves transforming individual characters within a string based on certain conditions.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: You need to handle the conversion between upper-case and lower-case letters, which requires understanding character codes or utilizing built-in functions specific to each programming language.

3. **Conditional Logic**: Implementing the transformation rules for both letter-based strings and non-letter characters involves conditional logic (e.g., `if`, `else if`, `else`).

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The problem includes conditions that need to be handled separately, such as reversing a string when there are no letters present.

5. **Functionality Implementation**: This challenge requires the implementation of specific functionality within a function (`solve`) which is called with one input argument (`s`), and returns another string or an altered version of it.

**Difficulty Level**: The problem can be considered intermediate to slightly advanced, depending on the background of the developer using it. A basic understanding of programming concepts, particularly those related to data types (strings) and control structures (conditions and loops) is necessary.

**Required Programming Skills**: Basic string handling skills are essential, along with proficiency in conditionals and possibly character manipulation based on ASCII values or built-in methods in your chosen programming language.

**Complexity**: The problem doesn't have a high computational complexity since it involves linear operations over the input string. However, the readability and effectiveness of the solution might depend heavily on how elegantly you manage to handle multiple conditions.

In summary, this problem is suitable for someone who has basic programming experience and wants to practice their skills in handling strings and applying conditional logic effectively. It challenges them to think about the order and conditionality of operations when processing input data.
