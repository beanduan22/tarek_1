The given problem can be categorized as an easy-level coding question. It tests your understanding of list manipulation and basic loop constructs in Python.

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **Understanding List Slicing:** You need to understand how to slice a list and how to concatenate multiple lists or insert elements at specific positions within a list.
2. **Looping over Lists:** The problem involves iterating through the given `numbers` list, which is crucial for inserting `delimeter` between each pair of consecutive numbers.

**Problem Complexity:**

The complexity in this question primarily lies in understanding how to apply an operation (insertion) on every consecutive element of a list. This requires careful consideration of loop conditions and how many times the operation needs to be executed based on the length of the input list.

Overall, solving this problem would require basic programming skills with lists, good attention to detail when handling indices or positions in the list, and understanding of simple control flow (loops). There is no need for advanced algorithms or complex logic.
