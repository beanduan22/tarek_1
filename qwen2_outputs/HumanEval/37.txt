The programming problem described above can be categorized as an **Intermediate Level** problem in terms of difficulty. This categorization is based on several factors:

1. **Required Programming Skills**: The problem requires basic knowledge of Python programming language, including list manipulation (`list`), data structures (arrays/lists), and control flow (using `if-else` statements). Understanding the concept of indexing in lists is also crucial.

2. **Problem Complexity**:
   - **Data Handling**: The task involves working with two different parts of an array (even and odd indices) simultaneously.
   - **Logic Implementation**: The logic requires separating even-index elements, sorting them, and then merging them back into their respective positions within the original list while keeping odd-index elements intact.

3. **Algorithmic Thinking**: This problem doesn't require complex algorithms or advanced data structures but does demand clear understanding of how to access specific indices in a list, sort elements, and merge two separate lists under certain conditions.

4. **Execution Steps**:
   - Iterate through the given list `l` while collecting even-indexed elements into another temporary list.
   - Sort this temporary list (even-index elements) using Python's built-in sorting method (`sort()` or `sorted()`).
   - Merge the sorted even-index elements back to their original positions in the main list while keeping odd-index elements unchanged.

Therefore, this problem is an intermediate level challenge that tests a programmer's understanding of basic programming constructs and logical sequencing rather than requiring advanced knowledge.
