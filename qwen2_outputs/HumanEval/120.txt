The problem described above is a classic selection problem in computer science, typically classified as easy to medium in terms of difficulty depending on prior knowledge. 

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **Sorting Algorithms:** The student must have some understanding of sorting algorithms since the problem ultimately requires selecting the maximum k elements from an array and sorting them.

2. **Array Manipulation:** Basic programming skills including how to access, modify or iterate through arrays are necessary as well.

3. **Conditional Logic:** To determine whether a number qualifies for inclusion in the final list based on its value compared to other selected numbers will require conditional logic like if statements.

**Problem Complexity:**

The problem's complexity mainly revolves around two aspects:

1. **Sorting:** Sorting an array can be done using various algorithms (like Quick sort, Merge sort, etc.) and each has its own trade-offs in terms of time complexity (e.g., Quick Sort typically performs well with average case complexities like O(n log n), while Merge Sort guarantees worst-case performance of O(n log n)). 

2. **Memory Usage:** When it comes to sorting the array first before picking the top k elements, one has to consider how much extra space is used for this operation.

However, since only k numbers need to be selected from an array of potentially up to 1000 numbers and they must be sorted, a simple approach that may involve using a built-in sort function followed by slicing the first k elements might suffice in many languages while maintaining reasonable performance considering constraints. The main bottleneck would likely be sorting rather than memory usage.

**Category:**

This problem can typically fall under algorithms or data structures categories but is more focused on understanding and implementing basic sorting techniques along with array handling, which points towards algorithm category for educational purposes such as learning about efficient ways to select top k items from a list. The use of conditional logic might also classify it under 'control flow' in some contexts.

In summary, this problem requires knowledge in sorting algorithms, array manipulation, and conditional logic with performance considerations leaning towards an intermediate difficulty level suitable for beginners or those looking to reinforce fundamental concepts in computer science programming.
