Based on the description of the problem provided:

- **Difficulty**: The problem asks for basic string manipulation and condition checking. It doesn't involve complex algorithms or data structures, making it relatively simple.

- **Required Programming Skills**: This question requires knowledge in Python (specifically string methods like `split`, indexing, and conditionals), understanding of regular expressions could help optimize the solution but isn't mandatory as no regex functions are used in the given examples. 

- **Complexity**: The problem is linear in nature; it goes through each character of the file name once using standard programming constructs (string slicing, loop, etc.). There's no recursion or nested loops that significantly increase complexity.

Overall, this question can be classified as an easy-to-moderate difficulty level problem requiring basic coding skills and knowledge on string handling.
