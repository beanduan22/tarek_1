This problem would likely be categorized as an **Intermediate** level question in terms of difficulty. It requires understanding and implementing several key concepts:

- **Sorting:** The code needs to sort the array elements which implies familiarity with sorting algorithms or built-in functions like `sorted()`.
  
- **Data Manipulation:** Reversing a list and replacing elements based on their values involves knowledge about how to manipulate lists in Python.

- **Mapping Values:** Mapping integers to their corresponding names indicates that some form of dictionary mapping (or similar data structure) might be used for this purpose.

- **Exception Handling:** The problem specifies to ignore any numbers outside the range 1 to 9 inclusive. This would require an if-statement or a condition-check to ensure only valid numbers are processed, demonstrating basic programming skills in handling conditions and flow control.

The complexity lies mainly in combining these concepts effectively. It requires the developer to write code that first does some basic math processing (filtering out integers), then performs sorting and reversing which involves traversal of arrays, followed by mapping them into string representations based on their values.

In terms of programming skills required:

- **Basic Python Programming:** Understanding of control flow structures (if statements, loops), variable handling, list operations etc.
  
- **Array/ List Manipulation:** Ability to sort lists, reverse lists and perform basic indexing and slicing would be beneficial.

- **Functionality and Logic Implementation:** Capability to translate the problem statement into a working piece of code using logic steps mentioned above.

So in summary, this question challenges one's understanding of data manipulation techniques and control flow structures within Python while also testing their ability to follow instructions step-by-step effectively. Intermediate skill level might be a good estimation based on these factors.
