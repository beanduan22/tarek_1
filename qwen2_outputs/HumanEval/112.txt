The given problem can be categorized under 'Easy to Medium Difficulty' in terms of programming problems. This is because it requires basic understanding of string manipulation techniques and conditional checks.

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **String Manipulation:** The primary skill needed here revolves around modifying strings based on certain conditions (in this case, removing characters matching those in another string). Python offers several built-in methods like `replace()` or slicing to manipulate strings effectively.

2. **Conditional Logic:** Implementing a check if the resulting string is a palindrome involves understanding how to compare two halves of the string with each other. This requires basic knowledge of loops and conditional statements, especially 'if-else' structures in Python.

**Complexity:**

The problem's complexity lies more in its execution than conceptual understanding as it primarily involves straightforward operations:
1. **Filtering out unwanted characters:** This operation scales linearly with the length of `s` and does not involve any nested loops or recursive calls.
2. **Checking for palindrome:** While this also scales with string size (but is O(n/2)), checking if a string reads the same backwards involves iterating through the first half of the string compared to its second half.

In summary, while the solution might require handling edge cases like empty strings or single-character strings in `c`, the overall problem does not involve complex data structures or advanced algorithms. The main challenge would be ensuring accuracy and efficiency in code implementation.
