Based on the given information about this problem:

- **Difficulty**: The task is relatively straightforward and involves basic operations such as looping through elements of a list, checking conditions (odd numbers in even positions), and performing arithmetic operations (summing up). It doesn't require advanced or complex algorithms. Therefore, I would categorize it as `Easy`.

- **Required Programming Skills**: The problem assumes familiarity with fundamental programming concepts:

  - **List manipulation** (`lst` variable indicates list comprehension).
  - **Conditional statements** (`if` statement to check if the number is odd and its position is even).
  - **Arithmetic operations** (`+` for addition).

- **Complexity**: The time complexity would be O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This means that as the size of the input grows, so does the execution time linearly because we iterate through each element exactly once to check conditions and perform a sum operation. There are no nested loops or recursive calls in this problem.

In summary:
- **Category**: This problem falls under `Easy` due to its simplicity.
- **Required Skills**: Basic programming skills including list manipulation, conditionals, and arithmetic operations.
- **Complexity**: The algorithmic complexity is linear (`O(n)`), making it suitable for beginners.
