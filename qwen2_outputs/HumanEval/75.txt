The given problem can be categorized into a medium-level difficulty problem. It requires basic understanding of prime numbers, loops, condition checks, function implementation, and arithmetic operations in programming.

Here's how you could approach this problem:

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: The first step is to create a helper function `is_prime(n)` that takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is prime or false otherwise.
2. **Factorize the Number**: Use the helper function to factorize the given number into its prime factors. You can do this by dividing the number successively by possible divisors starting from 2 until you reach a point where further division cannot result in an integer without fractions (i.e., when the divisor squared exceeds the number).
3. **Check if Exactly Three Prime Factors**: After factorizing, count the unique prime factors of the input number and return `True` if there are exactly three distinct primes; otherwise, return `False`.

Here is a Python code snippet implementing this approach:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Helper function to determine if n is a prime number."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_prime_factors(num):
    """Count the unique prime factors of a given number."""
    primes = set()
    for i in range(2, num+1):
        while num % i == 0 and is_prime(i):
            if not (num // i) in primes:
                primes.add(i)
            num //= i
    return len(primes)

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Check if the given number is the multiplication of exactly three prime numbers."""
    # First, ensure that 'a' is a product of three distinct prime factors.
    unique_factors = count_prime_factors(a)
    if unique_factors != 3:
        return False

    # Check each factor to confirm they are indeed primes and different from each other.
    for i in range(2, int(a**0.5) + 1):
        if a % i == 0 and is_prime(i) and (a // i) > 1 and is_prime(a // i):
            continue
        return False

    # If all checks pass, 'a' meets the criteria.
    return True


# Test cases
print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Expected output: True
print(is_multiply_prime(42))  # Expected output: True (2 * 3 * 7)
print(is_multiply_prime(69))  # Expected output: False (1x3x23, not three distinct primes)
```

This code snippet includes a helper function `is_prime` to check for prime numbers and another function `count_prime_factors` that counts unique prime factors. The main function `is_multiply_prime` checks if the input number is indeed a product of exactly three distinct prime factors using these functions.

By following this approach, you can solve the problem efficiently with reasonable time complexity as it relies on simple arithmetic operations and prime number checking which have relatively low computational cost for numbers less than 100.
