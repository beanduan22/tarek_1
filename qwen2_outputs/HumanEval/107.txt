This problem can be categorized as:

**Category: Beginner to Intermediate**

### Difficulty:
- **Conceptual Difficulty:** Low to Moderate
The problem involves fundamental concepts of mathematics (even/odd numbers), simple arithmetic operations, iteration, and string manipulation for checking palindrome property. No advanced programming constructs or complex algorithms are required.
- **Coding Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
While the implementation requires careful handling of edge cases (like single-digit numbers being both even and odd palindromes) and correct logic for counting even/odd palindromes within given constraints, it doesn't involve any recursive functions, advanced data structures, or complex loops.

### Required Programming Skills:
- **Control Structures:** Looping constructs (for loop), conditional statements (if-elif-else).
- **String Manipulation:** Basic string operations such as slicing and comparison.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Increment/decrement logic and arithmetic for counting even/odd numbers.
- **Function Definition:** Defining a function to encapsulate specific functionality.

### Algorithmic Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
Depending on the implementation, this problem can iterate through all numbers from 1 to n once. Therefore, time complexity is linear with respect to input size (n).
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) 
The space usage does not depend significantly on the input size since only a constant amount of space for variables are used.

### Overall:
This problem tests basic programming skills and understanding of number properties like even/odd, palindrome checking, and control flow management. It is suitable for beginners to practice their coding abilities while also challenging enough to ensure understanding of fundamental concepts in programming and algorithms.
