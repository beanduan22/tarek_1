The provided programming problem can be categorized as:

1. **Category: Basic Algorithm Problem**

   Difficulty Level: Medium

   Required Programming Skills:
   
   - Python List manipulation (list indexing, slicing)
   - Understanding of basic sorting algorithms or Python's built-in sort functions
   
   Complexity:
   
   - The task requires understanding the requirement to preserve the order of non-divisible-by-three elements while sorting divisible-by-three indices. This involves both list indexing and possibly custom logic for selection/sorting.
   - There is no recursion, large loop structures, or complex data structures used in this problem which keeps it relatively simple compared to advanced algorithm problems.

In summary, this programming problem tests basic skills like manipulating lists and understanding the conditions for sorting specific elements while preserving other elements' order. It falls under medium difficulty as it requires understanding of indexing, slicing along with a basic knowledge of sorting operations or algorithms.
