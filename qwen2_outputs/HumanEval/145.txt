The programming problem described above can be categorized as:

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Required Programming Skills**: 
- Basic knowledge of Python language syntax (list manipulation, lambda functions)
- Understanding of sorting algorithms and the `sort` method
- Ability to calculate the sum of digits in an integer
- Good understanding of sorting based on multiple criteria, i.e., secondary sort order when primary sorting is equal

**Complexity**: 
The problem primarily involves sorting a list of integers based on a specific condition. The complexity mainly lies in implementing the logic correctly and efficiently, while handling edge cases like empty lists or negative numbers.

The key challenge here is dealing with multiple sorting criteria (digit sum first, then index) when two elements have the same digit sum. This requires careful implementation to ensure that elements are sorted based on their original order if they meet the primary sorting criterion. 

Overall, this problem tests a good balance of basic programming skills and logical thinking around sorting algorithms while avoiding overly complex data structures or advanced concepts.
