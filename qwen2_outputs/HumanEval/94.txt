The problem provided is a mixed category type problem that requires knowledge of several programming concepts like working with lists, dealing with integers, identifying prime numbers, summing digits, etc. 

- **Difficulty Level**: The problem can be classified as **MEDIUM** difficulty because it involves multiple steps (finding the largest prime number in the list and then computing the sum of its digits) but doesn't require any advanced or deep knowledge of a specific programming concept.

- **Required Programming Skills**: 
    - **Understanding List Manipulation**: Being able to iterate over the given list to find elements that meet certain conditions.
    - **Prime Number Identification**: Writing logic or utilizing existing logic to identify whether an integer is prime. This might involve looping through numbers, performing division checks etc., which are standard loops and arithmetic operations in programming.
    - **Summing Digits of a Number**: Breaking down an integer into its individual digits and summing them up.

- **Complexity**: The complexity here lies mainly in managing these steps efficiently. For example, checking for primes could be optimized depending on the size of numbers involved; using precomputed lists of primes (like Sieve of Eratosthenes) can help reduce computational effort if this operation is performed multiple times.

In summary, while the problem does not require very advanced programming skills or complex algorithms, it does demand a good understanding and efficient implementation of fundamental concepts. This type of problem helps reinforce core programming knowledge as well as critical thinking about algorithm optimization and data structure usage in solving problems related to numbers and lists.
