This problem can be categorized as a medium-level programming challenge. Here's why:

**Required Programming Skills:** The solution requires basic understanding of Python programming concepts like list manipulation and sorting algorithms. It also involves logical reasoning to handle edge cases like when the list has less than 2 unique elements.

**Problem Complexity:** The function needs to iterate over the list at least once (to find the smallest element) and possibly a second time if necessary (to find the second smallest). This means that for an input of size n, it would have roughly O(n) time complexity due to sorting. Although this can be optimized by finding the smallest element in one pass and then looking for the next distinct minimum.

**Difficulty Level:** As there are no nested complexities like recursion or matrix operations, this problem is considered medium difficulty. It tests fundamental programming skills without delving too deeply into theoretical computer science concepts.

So overall, this would suit someone who has a basic understanding of Python syntax and logic to find the smallest element in a list but requires some knowledge on how to modify their approach when they encounter elements that are identical.
