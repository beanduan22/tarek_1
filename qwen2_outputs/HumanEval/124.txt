This programming problem is of medium difficulty. It requires good knowledge in string manipulation, conditional statements and understanding of date validation rules.

To solve this problem, you might need to apply techniques such as:
- String manipulation: extracting month, day, year from the input string using slicing or regular expressions.
- Conditionals: applying multiple condition checks based on extracted values for validating months, days and leap years.
- Handling edge cases: dealing with invalid inputs like single digit numbers, non-standard date formats, etc.

The problem involves checking specific rules about the date format, ranges of day/months and leap year validation which would require careful implementation to handle all possible scenarios. Thus, it is a suitable test for assessing someone's ability in those areas within programming skills.
