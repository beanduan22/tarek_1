The problem described can be categorized as follows:

**Difficulty Level**: Easy to Medium

**Required Programming Skills**: Basic understanding of loops (specifically for loop), conditional statements (if-else), arithmetic operations (+ and multiplication), list manipulation (append method) and familiarity with the concept of sequence generation based on conditions.

**Complexity**: Low-Moderate
The problem primarily involves a simple mathematical pattern recognition task, which is iteratively built through multiple levels. The complexity lies in understanding how to generate the sequence correctly for both odd and even numbers at each level. This requires careful handling of arithmetic operations and conditional logic within loops.

To solve this problem, one would start by creating an empty list that will store the number of stones in each level. Then iterate over a loop from 1 to n (inclusive), where n represents the total number of levels or the final count of stones. Based on whether the current iteration's value is odd or even, determine if it should represent an "odd" or "even" level respectively and calculate accordingly. 

For example:
- If the iteration index is odd, add the next odd number to the list (which can be achieved by incrementing twice (`i + 2`), starting from `1`)
- If the iteration index is even, add the next even number to the list (which can be achieved by incrementing once (`i + 1`)), starting from `2`

This process ensures the generation of a correct sequence for both odd and even total levels in the pile.

Overall, this problem tests basic programming concepts suitable for beginners or as a simple exercise to improve coding skills. It requires logical thinking and an understanding of basic arithmetic operations but doesn't involve advanced data structures or complex algorithms making it manageable for those starting with programming.
