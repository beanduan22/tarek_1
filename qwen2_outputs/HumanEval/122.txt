The given programming problem falls under the category of **Easy** in terms of difficulty level.

### Required Programming Skills:
1. **Array Manipulation**: The primary skill needed is working with arrays or lists to access elements by index. In Python, this usually involves basic syntax like `arr[index]`.

2. **Condition Checking**: The ability to use conditional statements (if-else) to check if an integer has at most two digits.

3. **Summation Functionality**: Summing up the valid numbers based on certain criteria is a simple operation using built-in functions or loops in programming languages like Python, Java, etc.

4. **Handling Input Arguments**: Understanding how to pass and validate input arguments from the function call site would be beneficial, though this problem doesn't require explicit validation as provided constraints cover most basic cases (like the length of `arr` being at least 1).

### Problem Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The primary operation here is iterating over the first `k` elements in the array to check if they are within the specified range and summing them up. In a straightforward implementation, this would result in `O(k)` complexity as you're essentially checking each element at most once.

- **Space Complexity**: Minimal space usage since no additional data structures like extra arrays or complex objects need to be created unless there's specific handling for large input sizes not covered by the constraints.

### Summary:
The problem requires basic familiarity with array manipulation and conditional checks, making it suitable for beginners. The solution could involve a simple loop that iterates over the first `k` elements of the array, checks each number to ensure it has at most two digits (i.e., is less than 100), and adds it to a running total if true.

For example, in Python:
```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    result = 0
    for i in range(k):
        num = arr[i]
        if 0 < num < 100:  # Check if the number has at most two digits
            result += num
    return result
```

This code snippet should be easily understandable and executable by someone with basic programming skills.
