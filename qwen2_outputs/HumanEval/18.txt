Based on the problem description provided:

- **Difficulty Level**: The problem involves string manipulation which is generally considered a fundamental skill in programming. This task requires an understanding of how to iterate through strings and count occurrences of substrings. For beginners or those new to Python, this might be challenging but straightforward for experienced programmers.
  
- **Required Programming Skills**:
   - Basic knowledge of using functions
   - Understanding string slicing (which allows for easy access to substrings)
   - Looping capabilities in Python

- **Complexity**: The solution requires a bit more thought than just simple iteration because it needs to account for overlapping occurrences. It's not overly complex, but it requires some algorithmic thinking beyond just basic string operations.

**Category Prediction**: Based on these factors, this programming problem can be categorized as **Easy/Medium in difficulty** since it assumes familiarity with the basics of Python and strings manipulation but might challenge those who are new to writing functions or dealing with edge cases like overlapping substrings. 

It's suitable for an intermediate-level coding challenge where students/practitioners could apply their knowledge while learning how to think about more complex string handling scenarios, such as counting occurrences that overlap within the string itself.
