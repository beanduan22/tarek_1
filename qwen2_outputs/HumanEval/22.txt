The provided programming problem is quite straightforward in nature. It focuses on filtering out integers from a given list that contains various Python values (including lists, dictionaries, strings, numbers etc.). The task doesn't require advanced techniques or complex logic - it primarily tests the ability to use list comprehensions and type checking with Python's `isinstance` function.

Based on these factors:

1. **Difficulty**: This problem is suitable for beginners who have basic knowledge of Python programming. It does not involve any advanced concepts, algorithms, or data structures that are typically associated with more complex problems.

2. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - Knowledge of how to manipulate lists in Python.
   - Understanding of basic syntax like loops and conditionals (if-else statements).
   - Familiarity with the `isinstance` function for type checking.
   - Ability to use list comprehensions effectively for concise code writing.

3. **Complexity**: The problem complexity is low because it doesn't require intricate algorithms, data structures, recursion, or high-level logic processing. It focuses on a simple task of filtering elements based on their type, which can be accomplished using straightforward techniques in Python.

In summary, the given programming problem falls into the category of "Easy" difficulty level for beginner programmers who are learning to work with lists and types in Python.
