The given problem is a basic algorithmic task in programming which falls under the category of "Searching" or "Sorting".

Difficulty Level: Easy

Required Programming Skills:
1. Basic understanding of Python language syntax and data structures (list).
2. Knowledge on how to access elements within lists by indexing.
3. Ability to write a function using def keyword.

Problem Complexity:
The problem involves only one operation - finding the maximum element in a list, which can be accomplished with just one line of code using built-in functions like `max()`. Therefore, it has low complexity and requires no advanced knowledge or algorithms beyond basic programming skills.

In summary, this problem tests your understanding of lists, indexing, function definition, and the use of built-in functions. It does not require any complex logic or algorithms for solving.
