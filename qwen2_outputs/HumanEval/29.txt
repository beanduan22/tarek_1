The problem falls under the category of Easy to Medium difficulty. 

Required Programming Skills: 
- Basic knowledge in Python is needed for this task since we're using Python language.
- Familiarity with lists manipulation and conditional checks is important.

Problem Complexity:
- The task involves filtering a list based on a condition (the strings starting with a specific prefix). This requires understanding of list comprehension or traditional 'for loop' methods for iterating over the input list.
- The solution doesn't involve complex data structures or algorithms, making it suitable for beginners and those learning Python.

So, this problem is designed to test basic programming skills in filtering lists based on certain conditions, which are fundamental concepts every programmer should know.
