This problem can be categorized as:

**Category: Algorithms / Data Structures**

*Difficulty Level: Medium*

*Required Programming Skills:*

1. **Understanding of Array/Lists**: The primary data structure used in this problem is an array or list.

2. **Basic Programming Concepts**: It requires knowledge about basic programming concepts like loops, conditional statements (if-else), and arrays.

3. **Algorithms for Searching and Sorting**: Although not explicitly mentioned, sorting and searching algorithms might be needed to find the smallest even node and its index efficiently.

*Problem Complexity:*

The problem has a moderate complexity due to:

1. **Scalability Concerns**: The array size can grow up to 10,000 elements which implies that time and space complexities should be considered while implementing an algorithm.
   
2. **Multiple Criteria for Selection**: The task involves not only finding the smallest even number but also considering its index in case of a tie.

3. **Edge Cases**: Handling scenarios like empty arrays or no even numbers in the array requires careful implementation to ensure robustness and correctness.

This problem would be suitable for an intermediate-level programmer looking to enhance their skills with practical coding exercises involving decision-making, searching algorithms, and understanding data structures.
