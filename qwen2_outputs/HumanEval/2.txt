The problem described here seems to be quite straightforward from a technical perspective and doesn't require advanced concepts or complex algorithms. It focuses mainly on basic programming skills such as understanding floating point numbers, using type annotations in Python (via the `-> float` syntax), and applying arithmetic operations.

**Difficulty Level:**

This problem is relatively easy for beginners who are familiar with the concept of floating-point representation and understand how to extract the integer part from a number. However, it might be slightly challenging for absolute beginners who are not yet comfortable with Python's type hinting or handling decimal numbers.

**Required Programming Skills:**

1. **Understanding Floating Point Numbers:** Basic understanding of floating-point numbers in programming languages.
2. **Type Annotations (Optional but recommended):** Knowing how to use type annotations like `-> float` helps in making the code more understandable and maintainable for others reading it.
3. **Basic Python Arithmetic Operations:** Ability to perform simple arithmetic operations, such as subtraction.

**Complexity:**

The problem has a low complexity because:
- The solution involves only basic programming constructs (type conversion, arithmetic operation).
- There are no nested loops, recursion, or complex conditional statements involved.
- It's not performance-intensive since it deals with single number operations.

In summary, this question targets the skillset of someone who is familiar with fundamental Python programming concepts and floating-point arithmetic. It doesn't require advanced knowledge or a deep understanding of algorithms or data structures. Therefore, it can be considered an easy-to-moderate level problem suitable for beginners or as part of a basic interview screening process to assess foundational skills.
