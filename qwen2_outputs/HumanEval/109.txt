The programming problem described above falls into the 'Easy' category. This categorization is based on several factors including:

**Difficulty Level:** The problem primarily involves understanding array manipulation through right shifts and comparing arrays for order. There are no advanced algorithmic concepts or complex data structures required, making it approachable for beginners.

**Required Programming Skills:** The solution requires basic knowledge of programming constructs such as loops, conditionals (for checking if the array is sorted), and array operations like shifting elements in an array. These are fundamental skills that most introductory programming courses cover.

**Complexity:** While there might be multiple ways to solve this problem, they involve straightforward iterations over the input list or array, making the solution relatively simple compared to other problems that require recursive functions, optimization techniques (like dynamic programming), graph theory algorithms, etc. 

To summarize, solving this problem mainly involves logical thinking around array manipulation and applying basic programming constructs efficiently to achieve an outcome based on given conditions.

Given these factors, one might approach this problem by implementing a function that:
1) Determines if the input list is already sorted.
2) If not, checks for the possibility of sorting it through right shifts. 

A simple way would involve checking if rotating the array by certain positions leads to a sorted array. This could be done with a loop that performs rotations and compares against an initially sorted version of the array (if possible).
