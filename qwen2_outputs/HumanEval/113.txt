The problem described above falls into the category of Easy to Medium difficulty level. This is because it requires basic understanding of programming concepts like list handling, string manipulation, loops, and conditional statements.

Here are some key aspects that make this problem moderately easy:

1. **Basic Programming Skills**: The task involves simple operations such as iterating over strings and counting specific characters (digits). No advanced structures or algorithms are required.

2. **Sequence Processing**: Working with lists of strings helps in practicing handling multiple data points, which is a fundamental skill for most programming tasks.

3. **String Manipulation**: This problem requires processing individual strings to count certain characteristics of their contentâ€”odd digits. String manipulation techniques like slicing and condition checks on characters are used here.

4. **Conditional Statements**: Decisions based on the nature of the digit (whether it's odd or not) necessitate if-else statements or similar constructs, which are essential programming skills.

5. **Output Formatting**: The output is required in a specific format that includes string replacements and number insertions. This requires careful handling of output strings to ensure they are constructed correctly.

To summarize, while this problem does involve some basic programming tasks requiring logical reasoning and attention to detail, it doesn't require advanced data structures or complex algorithms. Therefore, it could be considered easy-to-medium in terms of programming difficulty based on the skills listed above.
