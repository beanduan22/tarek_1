The problem presented above is categorized under "Algorithms" specifically focusing on "Number Theory". Here's why:

1. **Difficulty**: The task involves implementing an algorithm to find prime factors of a given integer, which falls into the medium-to-hard category of problems. This requires knowledge and understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science like loops, conditionals, and handling data structures such as lists.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: It demands skills related to logic and control flow (for-loops and conditionals). Additionally, it necessitates familiarity with the concept of prime numbers, which involves both mathematical reasoning and programming implementation.

3. **Complexity**: The solution might involve multiple steps - from handling edge cases (like factors beyond a certain limit or negative inputs), finding the smallest factors first (which requires sorting or sequential checking), and possibly optimizing for efficiency to handle larger integers without excessive computational cost.

4. **Data Structures Used**: Lists are used here as the output type, which suggests that an array-like structure is needed to store and return prime factors in their order of discovery.

In summary, this problem leans more towards developing a systematic approach to breaking down a number into its fundamental components based on divisibility rules, specifically focusing on the most basic building blocks - prime numbers. It's both mathematically and computationally challenging, making it suitable for an intermediate-level programming challenge.
