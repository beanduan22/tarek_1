The given programming problem can be categorized as:

**Category**: **Beginner to Intermediate Level**, *Algorithmic Problem Solving*

**Difficulty**: **Easy**

**Required Programming Skills**: 
1. **Understanding of basic Python programming**: The solution requires knowledge about loops (specifically for loop), conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), and basic operations on lists.
2. **Manipulating data structures**: Being able to iterate over a list, accessing elements by index, and modifying or computing values based on the index is necessary.
3. **Logical thinking**: The problem requires understanding of the conditions provided in the function description.

**Problem Complexity**:
The problem is relatively simple as it involves straightforward logic operations without deep complexity like recursion, advanced data structures, real-time application processing etc.

Overall, this problem serves well to practice and enhance skills related to conditional control flow inside loops based on index values. It's a good fit for someone learning Python programming or basic algorithmic problem-solving techniques.
