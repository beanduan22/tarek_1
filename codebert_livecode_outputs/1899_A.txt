Problem ID: 1899_A
Problem Content:
Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer $n$. On their turn, the player can add $1$ to the current integer or subtract $1$. The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by $3$, then he wins. If $10$ moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer $n$, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains the integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) — the number of test cases.

The single line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$).

Output

For each test case, print "First" without quotes if Vanya wins, and "Second" without quotes if Vova wins.Sample Input 1:
