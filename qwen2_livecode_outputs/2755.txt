Problem ID: 2755
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.


Example 2:

Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and "world" from index 8 to 12. The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
dictionary[i] and s consists of only lowercase English letters
dictionary contains distinct words

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem can be categorized as a **Dynamic Programming** problem with a slight twist. The main idea here is to break down the string (`s`) into substrings that exist in the given dictionary while minimizing the number of extra characters.

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Required Programming Skills**: 

1. **Understanding and Implementation of Dynamic Programming**
2. **String Manipulation**: Working with strings, finding patterns, etc.
3. **Recursion and Memoization**: To optimize recursive solutions by storing intermediate results for reuse (as seen in top-down DP).
4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Such as dealing with cases where no solution exists.

**Algorithm Complexity Analysis**: 

1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is primarily determined by the process of checking each substring against the dictionary and filling up the DP table. Since we're iterating through `s` once for forming substrings and then checking them against the dictionary, which itself could involve multiple comparisons (`O(n * m)` where `n` is length of `s`, and `m` is the average length of words in the dictionary), this can be considered as O(n^2 * m). However, with memoization, we avoid redundant computations by storing results for substrings.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity depends on the DP table which could potentially store up to 50 x 50 values (in a simplified view assuming the most naive implementation), hence it's `O(n^2)` due to using memoization or at least `O(n)` if we use recursion without explicit caching.

**General Solution Approach**:

1. **Initialization**: Create a DP table of size `(n+1) x n` (including zero index, as in the problem setup).
2. **Recursion**: Define a recursive function to check all possible splits for substrings ending at each position.
3. **Memoization**: Use this memoization technique to store results for already computed substrings, reducing repetitive computation.
4. **Optimization**: Return the minimum extra characters needed by trying every possible split and choosing the option that minimizes these additional characters.

This problem is quite intriguing because it combines string manipulation with optimization techniques like dynamic programming, providing a rich ground to explore different aspects of algorithmic thinking.
