Problem ID: 3242
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.
The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem can be categorized as an Easy-Medium level question in terms of difficulty.

**Required Programming Skills:**
- **Array/Hash Table Usage:** The solution would heavily rely upon storing frequencies of elements either using a hash table or sorting the input array first.
  
- **Counting Logic:** The program needs to iterate through the array and count the frequency of each element. This could involve nested loops for some solutions, but more optimized ones might use a hash map (unordered_map in C++).

**Algorithmic Complexity:**
1. **Time Complexity:** The naive approach would be O(n^2) if we were iterating over all elements twice to find frequencies and then count maximum frequency's occurrences. However, by utilizing an unordered_map or sorting the array first, we can reduce this to either O(nlogn) due to sorting (if that's considered more efficient in your context) or O(n) with a single pass using a map.

2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity would depend on how the frequencies are stored. An additional data structure like an unordered_map or another array could lead us to considering O(n) as worst-case scenario depending upon implementation details.
   
Overall, this problem is about understanding frequency distribution of elements in an array and efficiently handling counting tasks using a suitable data structure for improved performance. It involves basic programming concepts but requires the ability to think through optimal solutions considering time and space efficiency.
