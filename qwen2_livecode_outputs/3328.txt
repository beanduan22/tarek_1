Problem ID: 3328
Problem Content:
You are given a positive integer k. Initially, you have an array nums = [1].
You can perform any of the following operations on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

Choose any element in the array and increase its value by 1.
Duplicate any element in the array and add it to the end of the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of elements of the final array greater than or equal to k.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 11
Output: 5
Explanation:
We can do the following operations on the array nums = [1]:

Increase the element by 1 three times. The resulting array is nums = [4].
Duplicate the element two times. The resulting array is nums = [4,4,4].

The sum of the final array is 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 which is greater than or equal to k = 11.
The total number of operations performed is 3 + 2 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
The sum of the original array is already greater than or equal to 1, so no operations are needed.

 
Constraints:

1 <= k <= 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem can be categorized as a **Dynamic Programming** problem with some elements of **Greedy Algorithm**. 

### Difficulty Level:
- **Hard**: The solution requires understanding both DP and greedy strategies, along with careful consideration to optimize performance.

### Required Skills:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: You need the ability to break down the problem into sub-problems where a smaller instance is used to solve the larger one.
2. **Greedy Algorithm**: Deciding when to make an operation based on the current state and aiming for the optimal solution in each step can be tricky here.
3. **Mathematical Optimization**: The problem involves finding minimum operations, which necessitates a deep understanding of how addition affects sums.

### Complexity:
1. **Time Complexity**: Implementing DP with memoization (storing results of sub-problems) could lead to an overall time complexity close to \(O(k)\), making the solution efficient for input size constraints.
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity might be around \(O(k)\) due to storing DP states, depending on how you implement memoization.

### Problem-Solving Steps:
1. **Understand the Operations**:
   - Increasing an element by 1 is essentially adding 1 more to its contribution in sums.
   - Duplicating an element means effectively multiplying the sum contribution of that number by \(2\) (as it's now contributing twice).

2. **Optimization Through Greedy Strategy**:
   - Initially, consider a greedy approach where always choosing the smallest possible operation (incrementing or duplicating) might not be optimal because of the diminishing returns of each additional operation in terms of contribution to the sum.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - Since directly calculating all possibilities might be too complex and inefficient, dynamic programming can help in storing intermediate results (optimal operations for sums up to \(k\)) efficiently.
   - This approach involves defining a state based on the target sum (\(k\)) and building up solutions from smaller states.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - The insight that lies behind solving this problem effectively is realizing when it's optimal to increase or duplicate elements versus their impact on reaching \(k\) efficiently.
   - This might involve analyzing how quickly sums grow with each operation type, identifying a threshold where the next logical step switches from incrementing to duplicating.

### Implementation:
The actual code implementation would involve defining states in DP (like sum so far and number of operations used), deciding which operation to perform based on calculated values, ensuring that you don't exceed \(k\) by too much when reaching close to it with each additional operation (since later operations might not contribute significantly).

Thus, while this problem can be quite challenging due to its combination of DP and greedy concepts, understanding the key insights provides a pathway to solving it efficiently.
