Problem ID: 3044
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums of positive integers and an integer k.
In one operation, you can remove the last element of the array and add it to your collection.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to collect elements 1, 2, ..., k.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,5,4,2], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: After 4 operations, we collect elements 2, 4, 5, and 1, in this order. Our collection contains elements 1 and 2. Hence, the answer is 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,5,4,2], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: After 5 operations, we collect elements 2, 4, 5, 1, and 3, in this order. Our collection contains elements 1 through 5. Hence, the answer is 5.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,2,5,3,1], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: After 4 operations, we collect elements 1, 3, 5, and 2, in this order. Our collection contains elements 1 through 3. Hence, the answer is 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length
1 <= k <= nums.length
The input is generated such that you can collect elements 1, 2, ..., k.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem seems to be of medium difficulty as it involves array manipulation, sorting, and tracking of collected elements. Here are several factors that make this problem mid-level:

- **Problem-solving Techniques**: It requires a combination of using data structures (like arrays or hash sets for tracking) along with algorithmic concepts like iteration or simple recursion.

- **Algorithm Complexity**: The solution isn't trivial as it needs to iterate through the array and compare each element against `k`, while also counting how many operations are needed to collect all numbers from 1 up to `k`. This involves some form of computation for tracking progress, which may include sorting elements before processing them.

- **Time Complexity**: Since we must potentially visit every single item in `nums` (in the worst case scenario) and possibly perform additional checks on each item depending on how many items are less than `k`, this could imply a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of `nums`. 

- **Space Complexity**: If you're using an extra data structure to track collected elements, then the space complexity could be dependent on the number of unique elements up to `k` which would be at most `k`.

So based on these points, this problem might belong under categories like Data Structures and Algorithms with focus on Array manipulation, Counting/Tracking logic, and Basic Sorting. The main skills required are understanding array operations, being able to compare different values against a target condition (`k`), managing state (number of collected elements up to `k`) during the process, which includes both forward iteration over array elements and potentially some form of tracking of progress.

The key steps could involve iterating through or sorting the array while keeping track of how many operations were needed until all numbers from 1 to k are in your collection. This might require using a loop to go through each element in `nums` and possibly a counter to keep score of your moves.
