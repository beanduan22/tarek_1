Problem ID: 2882
Problem Content:
Given two positive integers n and x.
Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the x^th power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n_1, n_2, ..., n_k] where n = n_1^x + n_2^x + ... + n_k^x.
Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 2^3 + 3^3 + 5^3.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 10, x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: We can express n as the following: n = 3^2 + 1^2 = 10.
It can be shown that it is the only way to express 10 as the sum of the 2^nd power of unique integers.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, x = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can express n in the following ways:
- n = 4^1 = 4.
- n = 3^1 + 1^1 = 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 300
1 <= x <= 5

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the analysis of this problem statement, we can identify several aspects that contribute to understanding its nature:

1. **Problem Type**: The task involves finding combinations (or permutations) of integers raised to a certain power (x-th power) that sum up to a specific target number (n). This is akin to combinatorics and optimization problems.

2. **Algorithmic Approach**: The solution requires iterating over possible integers, checking their x-th powers against the target n while keeping track of unique combinations. This implies a dynamic programming approach or recursion with backtracking might be useful techniques for solving this problem.

3. **Complexity**: Given the constraints (n ≤ 300 and 1 ≤ x ≤ 5), brute-force solutions are likely feasible but not optimal in terms of time complexity. The space complexity is also moderate, as we may need to store intermediate results related to combinations.

4. **Optimization Needed**: Since there's a constraint on the size of n (up to 300) and x (up to 5), optimizations such as memoization or pruning in recursion might be necessary to avoid redundant calculations.

Considering these points, this problem can potentially fall under the categories:

- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Combinatorics**
- **Backtracking**

It involves algorithmic thinking rather than just syntax knowledge. The solution would require understanding of loops, conditionals, data structures (like maps or sets for tracking unique integers), and basic math operations like exponentiation.

The required programming skills are mostly related to good problem-solving strategies and the ability to implement recursive functions or dynamic programming solutions. Understanding how to handle constraints efficiently is also crucial here. 

In terms of difficulty, this can be considered **Medium** as it involves multiple concepts and requires a bit more thought than straightforward problems but doesn't delve into very complex data structures or algorithms that are typically found in harder problems.

The problem encourages understanding of computational complexity (like time complexity due to the number of calculations needed) which aligns with learning how to optimize solutions based on given constraints.
