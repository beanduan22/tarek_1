Problem ID: 3344
Problem Content:
You are given a array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where points[i] = [x_i, y_i].
The distance between two points is defined as their Manhattan distance.
Return the minimum possible value for maximum distance between any two points by removing exactly one point.
 
Example 1:

Input: points = [[3,10],[5,15],[10,2],[4,4]]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The maximum distance after removing each point is the following:

After removing the 0^th point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.
After removing the 1^st point the maximum distance is between points (3, 10) and (10, 2), which is |3 - 10| + |10 - 2| = 15.
After removing the 2^nd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (4, 4), which is |5 - 4| + |15 - 4| = 12.
After removing the 3^rd point the maximum distance is between points (5, 15) and (10, 2), which is |5 - 10| + |15 - 2| = 18.

12 is the minimum possible maximum distance between any two points after removing exactly one point.

Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,1],[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Removing any of the points results in the maximum distance between any two points of 0.

 
Constraints:

3 <= points.length <= 10^5
points[i].length == 2
1 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem is a moderate to hard level question in computer science that focuses on understanding of algorithms (specifically sorting), data structures (arrays), and problem-solving strategies. 

1) **Problem Category**: This falls under the category of "Greedy Algorithms" since it involves making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a globally optimal solution.

2) **Required Programming Skills**: The skills required would include proficient knowledge of sorting algorithms, understanding of array manipulations and operations, and ability to implement algorithmic logic effectively in code. Good problem-solving strategy also plays an important role, specifically thinking through the impact of removing one point and trying to optimize distance calculations.

3) **Algorithm Complexity**: As this question involves sorting a list of points first which is O(n log n), followed by computing distances between all pairs after removing each point once (which would be approximated as O(2n * m/2) where 'm' is the number of operations needed to compute distances for two points). This makes it an efficient problem, but still challenging given its requirement for careful implementation and optimization.

4) **Data Structure Complexity**: The data structure used here is a simple array. However, sorting this array introduces complexity as well, which might need careful consideration in terms of efficiency.

In conclusion, this problem would be ideal to assess skills related to algorithmic thinking, efficient use of data structures, and implementation precision, making it suitable for intermediate to advanced level coding interviews or assessments.
