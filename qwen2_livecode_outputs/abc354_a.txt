Problem ID: abc354_a
Problem Content:
Takahashi is growing a plant. Its height at the time of germination is 0\,\mathrm{cm}. Considering the day of germination as day 0, its height increases by 2^i\,\mathrm{cm} day i's night (0 \le i).
Takahashi's height is H\,\mathrm{cm}.
Every morning, Takahashi measures his height against this plant.  Find the first day such that the plant's height is strictly greater than Takahashi's height in the morning.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
H

Output

Print an integer representing the first day such that the plant's height is greater than Takahashi's height in the morning.

Constraints


- 1 \leq H \leq 10^{9}
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

54

Sample Output 1

6

The plant's height in the mornings of days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 will be 1\,\mathrm{cm}, 3\,\mathrm{cm}, 7\,\mathrm{cm}, 15\,\mathrm{cm}, 31\,\mathrm{cm}, 63\,\mathrm{cm}, respectively. The plant becomes taller than Takahashi in the morning day 6, so print 6.

Sample Input 2

7

Sample Output 2

4

The plant's height will be 7\,\mathrm{cm} in the morning of day 3 and 15\,\mathrm{cm} in the morning day 4. The plant becomes taller than Takahashi in the morning of day 4, so print 4. Note that, in the morning of day 3, the plant is as tall as Takahashi, but not taller.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem presented here involves a mathematical concept of exponential growth with an application to a practical scenario. It requires understanding of basic mathematics (exponents), iteration through programming concepts (loops or arithmetic progression), and conditional logic (comparing values). This indicates that the problem falls under the category of "Easy-Medium" difficulty level, requiring fundamental knowledge in programming and mathematical computation.

The key skills needed for solving this problem are:

1. **Basic Programming Skills**: Understanding how to use loops (like a `for` loop or similar constructs) is important as we need to iterate through days until the height requirement is met.
2. **Mathematical Computation**: Basic arithmetic operations and an understanding of powers/exponential growth are essential because the height increases exponentially based on day's number power of 2.
3. **Conditional Logic**: The problem requires comparing two values (Takahashi's height and plant's height) to determine when the condition is met.

The complexity aspect revolves around efficiencyâ€”writing a program that can handle large inputs effectively (since H could go up to $10^9$). However, given the nature of the exponential growth formula used in this problem, it implies that the number of iterations required will grow logarithmically with respect to H. This makes the time complexity relatively efficient.

In summary, this problem is well-suited for beginners or intermediate programmers who have grasped basic concepts of programming and are familiar with handling mathematical computations within algorithms. The solution would typically involve a loop that iterates through each day until the plant's height surpasses Takahashi's height.
