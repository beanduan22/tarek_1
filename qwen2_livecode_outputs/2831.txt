Problem ID: 2831
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of indices i, j where 0 <= i < j < nums.length is called beautiful if the first digit of nums[i] and the last digit of nums[j] are coprime.
Return the total number of beautiful pairs in nums.
Two integers x and y are coprime if there is no integer greater than 1 that divides both of them. In other words, x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1, where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,1,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 beautiful pairs in nums:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[1] is 5. We can confirm that 2 and 5 are coprime, since gcd(2,5) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 2, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(2,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[2] is 1. Indeed, gcd(5,1) == 1.
When i = 1 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[1] is 5, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(5,4) == 1.
When i = 2 and j = 3: the first digit of nums[2] is 1, and the last digit of nums[3] is 4. Indeed, gcd(1,4) == 1.
Thus, we return 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [11,21,12]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful pairs:
When i = 0 and j = 1: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[1] is 1. Indeed, gcd(1,1) == 1.
When i = 0 and j = 2: the first digit of nums[0] is 1, and the last digit of nums[2] is 2. Indeed, gcd(1,2) == 1.
Thus, we return 2.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 9999
nums[i] % 10 != 0

### Analysis:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves iterating through a given list of integers (`nums`), extracting first digits from each element and last digits from every possible pair, computing their greatest common divisor (GCD) and checking if they are coprime to count beautiful pairs.

2. **Approach Overview**:

   - Initialize a counter for the number of beautiful pairs.
   - Loop through `nums`, extract the first digit for each element (`num`).
   - For each `num`, loop through `nums` again to find suitable `j` (where j > i) such that:
     - Last digit of `nums[j]` is obtained and compared with `firstDigit`.
     - Compute GCD of `firstDigit` and last digit.
     - If GCD equals 1, increment the count.

3. **Optimization**:

   - To optimize this solution for large inputs where `nums[i] <= 9999`, consider that extracting first digits might not directly yield unique values since numbers are limited to single-digit in magnitude (`nums[i] % 10 != 0`). We can optimize further by calculating all possible first and last digit combinations beforehand (if the problem constraints allow) for faster lookup during pair checking.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The nested loop structure leads to a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the size of `nums`.
   - Optimization might bring this down significantly if we precompute first and last digits in constant time operations (constant space).

5. **Space Complexity**:
   - This solution doesn't require substantial additional data structures, so space complexity could be considered low, potentially O(1) excluding input/output variables.

### Implementation Considerations:

- Efficient GCD calculation is crucial; using built-in math libraries or efficient algorithms can improve performance.
- Precomputing digit lists (first digits of each number and last digits for all pairs) might allow a faster lookup during the main loop iterations, potentially reducing time complexity from quadratic to linear if the problem constraints permit this optimization.

Overall, while the initial approach is feasible, there's room for optimization through precomputation or further algorithmic improvements specific to the constraints described in the problem.
