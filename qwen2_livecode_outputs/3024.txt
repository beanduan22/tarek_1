Problem ID: 3024
Problem Content:
You are given two strings s and t of equal length n. You can perform the following operation on the string s:

Remove a suffix of s of length l where 0 < l < n and append it at the start of s.
	For example, let s = 'abcd' then in one operation you can remove the suffix 'cd' and append it in front of s making s = 'cdab'.

You are also given an integer k. Return the number of ways in which s can be transformed into t in exactly k operations.
Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdab", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
First way:
In first operation, choose suffix from index = 3, so resulting s = "dabc".
In second operation, choose suffix from index = 3, so resulting s = "cdab".

Second way:
In first operation, choose suffix from index = 1, so resulting s = "bcda".
In second operation, choose suffix from index = 1, so resulting s = "cdab".

Example 2:

Input: s = "ababab", t = "ababab", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 
First way:
Choose suffix from index = 2, so resulting s = "ababab".

Second way:
Choose suffix from index = 4, so resulting s = "ababab".

 
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^15
s.length == t.length
s and t consist of only lowercase English alphabets.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem involves performing a series of string manipulation operations in order to transform one string `s` into another string `t`. The transformation process is quite specific: a suffix can be removed from `s` and appended at the beginning. This question combines concepts related to string handling, recursion or iteration, and modulo arithmetic.

**Difficulty:** 

Considering that the problem involves modifying strings through a series of operations, it requires an understanding of how strings are handled in programming languages. Also, the constraint involving modulo operation necessitates knowledge of basic mathematical concepts. Furthermore, dealing with large numbers (up to \(10^{15}\)) indicates that the algorithm should be efficient and optimized for large inputs.

**Required Programming Skills:**

- **String Manipulation:** The problem requires operations on strings such as substring extraction and modification.
- **Recursion or Iteration:** To solve this problem, one would likely need a loop to iterate through possible suffixes of `s` that can be used in the transformation process. This could involve recursive calls if implemented using recursion.
- **Efficiency and Optimization:** Since there are constraints on input size (up to \(5 \times 10^5\)) and time complexity considerations due to large value operations, efficient algorithms should be implemented.

**Complexity:**

Given that the problem asks for an exact count of transformations (`k` operations) required to change `s` into `t`, it leans towards a **Dynamic Programming** or **Recursion with Memoization** approach. The solution needs to traverse through different possible states (suffixes), which can indicate exponential time complexity (\(O(n^2)\)) for brute-force methods without optimization.

The complexity might actually be higher due to the constraints on `n` and `k`. To optimize this problem, one would need to ensure that duplicate computations are avoided by storing intermediate results in a lookup table (memoization) or using dynamic programming to build up solutions from smaller subproblems.

**Category:**

This problem can be categorized under **String Algorithms**, **Dynamic Programming**, **Recursion**, and **Optimization Techniques**. It combines concepts of string manipulation, algorithmic thinking to solve problems involving strings through multiple iterations, and optimization strategies like memoization or dynamic programming for efficient computation. The difficulty level might range from **Medium to Hard**, depending on the approach taken and understanding required to implement optimizations effectively.

In conclusion, while this question involves some fundamental aspects of programming and string manipulation, its complexity and constraints make it challenging enough for someone looking to deepen their skills in algorithm design and efficiency optimization.
