Problem ID: 3374
Problem Content:
You are given a binary array nums.
We call a subarray alternating if no two adjacent elements in the subarray have the same value.
Return the number of alternating subarrays in nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The following subarrays are alternating: [0], [1], [1], [1], and [0,1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,0]
Output: 10
Explanation:
Every subarray of the array is alternating. There are 10 possible subarrays that we can choose.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The provided programming problem involves analyzing a binary array to count alternating subarrays. This requires understanding of array manipulation and iterating through the elements in an efficient manner.

**Category Prediction:**

- **Difficulty Level:** Easy to Medium
  - The problem involves basic array operations such as iteration, which is quite straightforward but crucial for algorithmic problem-solving.
  
- **Required Programming Skills:**
  - Basic programming skills with a good understanding of loops (for or while) and array manipulation.
  - Ability to handle edge cases in arrays like having just one element or empty array.

- **Complexity:** Linear O(n)
  - The solution involves iterating through the array once, making it linear complexity where n is the size of the input array. This indicates an efficient approach as we don't need any nested loops or additional space proportional to the input size.

**Approach and Logic:**

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Initialization:** Start by initializing two variables, `prev` (to store the previous element) and `count` (to keep track of alternating subarrays). Set them initially to `nums[0]` and `1`, respectively.
2. **Iterate through Array:**
   - Loop through each element in the array starting from index 1.
   - For every new element encountered:
     - If it's different than the previous element (`nums[i] != prev`), increment `count` by twice its current value because we can start a new alternating subarray with either of the two adjacent values. 
       This logic considers that both elements contribute to an alternating pattern.
     - Update `prev` to the current element for future comparisons.

3. **Return Result:**
   After completing the loop, return `count`, which now holds the total number of alternating subarrays.

This approach ensures every possible alternating subarray is counted without missing any or counting duplicates due to its systematic increment logic based on differences between adjacent elements.

**Conclusion:**

The problem falls under basic algorithmic challenges focusing on understanding array patterns and implementing simple yet efficient iteration techniques for counting specific sub-structures within the data. It effectively combines fundamental programming skills with logical reasoning about sequences, making it suitable for beginners looking to enhance their problem-solving abilities in a linear complexity context.
