Problem ID: 3402
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums and two integers cost1 and cost2. You are allowed to perform either of the following operations any number of times:

Choose an index i from nums and increase nums[i] by 1 for a cost of cost1.
Choose two different indices i, j, from nums and increase nums[i] and nums[j] by 1 for a cost of cost2.

Return the minimum cost required to make all elements in the array equal. 
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,1], cost1 = 5, cost2 = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: 
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,2].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,3].
Increase nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 5. nums becomes [4,4].

The total cost is 15.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,3,5], cost1 = 2, cost2 = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] and nums[1] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [3,4,3,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,4,4,3,5].
Increase nums[0] and nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,4,4,4,5].
Increase nums[1] and nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5,4,5].
Increase nums[3] by 1 for a cost of 2. nums becomes [5,5,5,5,5].

The total cost is 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,5,3], cost1 = 1, cost2 = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
The following operations can be performed to make the values equal:

Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [4,5,3].
Increase nums[0] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,3].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,4].
Increase nums[2] by 1 for a cost of 1. nums becomes [5,5,5].

The total cost is 4.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= cost1 <= 10^6
1 <= cost2 <= 10^6

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem involves manipulating an integer array to make all elements equal using specific operations while minimizing the total cost. This problem requires understanding of array manipulation, optimization strategies like dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, and efficient computation for large input sizes (due to constraints provided). The problem is likely categorized under 'Medium' difficulty level considering:

1) **Required Programming Skills**: It involves basic data structures such as arrays, and algorithms related to dynamic programming or greedy approaches.
2) **Difficulty Level**: The question asks for the minimum cost required, which suggests optimization strategies should be employed. Moreover, handling large input sizes necessitates efficient coding practices like optimized loops or utilizing built-in functions to minimize time complexity.
3) **Complexity**: The problem requires identifying patterns in array values and deciding whether to increment individual elements using operation 1 (which has a lower cost per operation), or choosing two elements for operation 2, which is more expensive but allows the increase of multiple elements at once.

Therefore, this problem would fall under categories like 'Dynamic Programming', 'Greedy Algorithms', or perhaps 'Array Manipulation' depending on how you solve it. It tests both understanding of these algorithms and their practical implementation while considering constraints to ensure efficiency for large inputs.
