Problem ID: abc309_a
Problem Content:
We have the following 3 \times 3 board with integers from 1 through 9 written on it.

You are given two integers A and B between 1 and 9, where A < B.
Determine if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

Print Yes if the two squares with A and B written on them are adjacent horizontally, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1 \le A < B \le 9
- A and B are integers.

Sample Input 1

7 8

Sample Output 1

Yes

The two squares with 7 and 8 written on them are adjacent horizontally, so print Yes.

Sample Input 2

1 9

Sample Output 2

No

Sample Input 3

3 4

Sample Output 3

No

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above is a simple logic-based question that involves basic concepts of input handling, conditional statements, and array manipulation (in this case, just for understanding the position of elements). The question doesn't require any specific knowledge of algorithms or data structures.

**Category Prediction:**

1. **Difficulty:** Easy to medium
   - It primarily tests basic programming skills such as reading inputs correctly from stdin and handling simple conditions.
   
2. **Required Programming Skills:**
   - Input/output operations
   - Basic conditional statements (like if-else)
   - Understanding of array-like positions or mappings, even though it is applied very simply in this question
  
3. **Complexity:**
   - Low complexity, as there are no nested loops, recursive calls, or advanced data structures.
   - The logic behind determining adjacency can be implemented with just a few lines of code.

The overall problem can be considered suitable for beginners who are learning basic programming concepts and need practice in handling simple input-processing tasks. It is designed to help them understand fundamental programming principles without getting overly bogged down by complexity or advanced concepts.
