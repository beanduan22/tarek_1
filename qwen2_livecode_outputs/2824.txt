Problem ID: 2824
Problem Content:
You are given an integer n that consists of exactly 3 digits.
We call the number n fascinating if, after the following modification, the resulting number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once and does not contain any 0's:

Concatenate n with the numbers 2 * n and 3 * n.

Return true if n is fascinating, or false otherwise.
Concatenating two numbers means joining them together. For example, the concatenation of 121 and 371 is 121371.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 192
Output: true
Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 192 and 2 * n = 384 and 3 * n = 576. The resulting number is 192384576. This number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Example 2:

Input: n = 100
Output: false
Explanation: We concatenate the numbers n = 100 and 2 * n = 200 and 3 * n = 300. The resulting number is 100200300. This number does not satisfy any of the conditions.

 
Constraints:

100 <= n <= 999

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided, this problem involves basic operations like string concatenation and arithmetic calculations. It also requires checking conditions regarding digit presence within a resulting number.

**Problem Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Basic understanding of data types:** The problem deals with integers that are converted into strings for concatenation.
2. **String manipulation:** Concatenating two numbers by joining them together as strings is needed here.
3. **Arithmetic operations:** Simple multiplication and comparison of the resulting number against predefined conditions.

**Complexity:**
1. **Time Complexity:** The time complexity would be relatively low due to its linear nature involving a straightforward algorithm. The concatenation operation scales with the input size (logarithmic in terms of digits), but since it involves only three inputs, this is effectively constant time per number.
2. **Space Complexity:** This problem has a space complexity of O(1) as there are no data structures that scale directly with the input size. The primary storage requirements are for temporary variables and do not depend on the magnitude of `n`.

**Category Prediction:**
This problem would fall into categories such as:
- **Basic Algorithmic Problems**: Suitable for beginners to understand basic concepts like string manipulation, arithmetic operations, and conditional checks.
- **Interview Preparation Questions**: Often found in coding interviews for evaluating fundamental programming skills.
- **Educational Example**: Good for teaching the principles of simple algorithms using concrete examples.
