Problem Content:
You are given a non-negative integer k. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of stairs, with the lowest stair numbered 0.
Alice has an integer jump, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach stair k using any number of operations. If she is on stair i, in one operation she can:

Go down to stair i - 1. This operation cannot be used consecutively or on stair 0.
Go up to stair i + 2^jump. And then, jump becomes jump + 1.

Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair k.
Note that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair k, and performs some operations to reach the stair k again.
 
Example 1:

Input: k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation:
The 2 possible ways of reaching stair 0 are:

Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.




Example 2:

Input: k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The 4 possible ways of reaching stair 1 are:

Alice starts at stair 1. Alice is at stair 1.
Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.


Alice starts at stair 1.
	
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^0 stairs to reach stair 1.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 0.
Using an operation of the second type, she goes up 2^1 stairs to reach stair 2.
Using an operation of the first type, she goes down 1 stair to reach stair 1.




 
Constraints:

0 <= k <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
The programming problem described above can be categorized as a dynamic programming question with a medium level of difficulty. 

**Required Programming Skills:**
- **Dynamic Programming**: The problem requires finding an optimal solution by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and using the solutions to these subproblems to construct the final answer.
- **Recursion**: The operations Alice can perform are defined recursively, involving either moving down one step or jumping up multiple steps based on her current jump count.

**Complexity:**
The problem involves working with large numbers due to the constraint `0 <= k <= 10^9`, which necessitates careful handling of arithmetic and potential optimizations for performance.

**Approach:**
Dynamic programming typically involves memoization (storing results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again) or building up a table where each cell represents the number of ways to reach a certain stair with a specific jump count. The key steps would involve:
1. **Initialization**: Setting base cases, such as having no way to reach stairs 0 (initial state for both operations).
2. **Recursion / Iteration**: For each step `i` starting from `k`, calculate the number of ways by considering both down and up operations.
3. **Optimization**: To avoid repetitive computation, use memoization or a table to store intermediate results.

This problem tests one's ability to handle large numbers effectively using dynamic programming techniques and recursion, while also ensuring efficient resource usage given constraints on time and space complexity.
