Problem ID: 2811
Problem Content:
You are given two integers, n and k.
An array of distinct positive integers is called a k-avoiding array if there does not exist any pair of distinct elements that sum to k.
Return the minimum possible sum of a k-avoiding array of length n.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, k = 4
Output: 18
Explanation: Consider the k-avoiding array [1,2,4,5,6], which has a sum of 18.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 18.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, k = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: We can construct the array [1,2], which has a sum of 3.
It can be proven that there is no k-avoiding array with a sum less than 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, k <= 50

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem falls under the category of "Dynamic Programming" given its focus on optimization (finding the minimum possible sum) and using smaller subproblems to solve larger ones.

The required programming skills include:
- Problem-solving with arrays and integers
- Ability to think recursively or in terms of subproblems 
- Understanding the concept of dynamic programming, though it's not strictly necessary as there might be a more direct approach

In terms of complexity:

- Time Complexity: The brute force method would involve checking every possible combination which is exponential (O(k^n)). However, given constraints with k and n being up to 50, this is quite feasible in practice. A more optimized solution could be linear or close to it.
- Space Complexity: It depends on the implementation but could potentially be O(n) as you might need arrays to store intermediate results.

For a competitive programming contest, this problem would likely be placed at medium difficulty due to its requirement of finding an optimal solution through a specific algorithmic approach. However, for more casual or interview settings, given constraints it might lean towards easy-moderate since the optimization is not too complex but requires careful consideration.
