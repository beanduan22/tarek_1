Problem Content:
You are given a 1-indexed integer array nums of length n.
An element nums[i] of nums is called special if i divides n, i.e. n % i == 0.
Return the sum of the squares of all special elements of nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 21
Explanation: There are exactly 3 special elements in nums: nums[1] since 1 divides 4, nums[2] since 2 divides 4, and nums[4] since 4 divides 4. 
Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of nums is nums[1] * nums[1] + nums[2] * nums[2] + nums[4] * nums[4] = 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 21.  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,1,19,18,3]
Output: 63
Explanation: There are exactly 4 special elements in nums: nums[1] since 1 divides 6, nums[2] since 2 divides 6, nums[3] since 3 divides 6, and nums[6] since 6 divides 6. 
Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of nums is nums[1] * nums[1] + nums[2] * nums[2] + nums[3] * nums[3] + nums[6] * nums[6] = 2 * 2 + 7 * 7 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 63. 

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length == n <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem is categorized under "Easy" level problems in coding contests such as LeetCode or HackerRank. It falls under the domain of Array manipulation and basic mathematical operations (sums and square calculations). This category typically involves straightforward algorithms that require understanding of basic data structures like arrays, loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.

The required programming skills for solving this problem include:
1. **Looping through an array**: The code needs to iterate over the elements of the input array `nums`.
2. **Conditional logic**: Determining if a given index meets the criteria (i.e., whether i divides n) is based on conditional statements.
3. **Basic arithmetic operations**: Calculating squares and sums are fundamental mathematical computations.

The complexity analysis:
- **Time Complexity:** The problem involves iterating through the array once, which results in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** Since we do not use extra space proportional to the input size (except for storing the sum), the space complexity is considered constant or O(1).

Overall, this problem challenges basic programming and mathematical skills without requiring advanced algorithms or data structures, making it suitable for beginners or as a warm-up exercise.
