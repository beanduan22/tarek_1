Problem ID: 3094
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array any number of times:

Choose two elements with equal values and delete them from the array.
Choose three elements with equal values and delete them from the array.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty, or -1 if it is not possible.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].
- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].
- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].
It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to empty the array.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above falls under the category of **Algorithm Design** which focuses on developing efficient solutions to computational tasks. This specific problem tests several key skills:

### Difficulty:
1. **Logical Reasoning**: Understanding the operations that can be performed is crucial in this problem. It requires a clear grasp of the rules and how they affect the array.
2. **Data Processing**: Efficiently processing an input array of potentially large size (up to 10^5 elements) to determine the minimum number of operations required implies skills in handling data structures effectively.

### Required Programming Skills:
1. **Hash Table Usage**: Utilizing a hash table or dictionary to count occurrences of each element in the array allows for efficient frequency counting.
2. **Mathematical Computation**: The logic involves simple arithmetic (addition and division) but also requires considering edge cases like when certain elements cannot be operated on due to constraints.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: Depending on the implementation, this could range from O(n log n) if sorting is involved in counting frequencies, to linear time complexity O(n), where each element is counted once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space required for storing frequency counts depends on the number of unique elements. In the worst case (when each distinct element occurs only once), it would require O(n) additional space.

### Solution Approach:
The problem involves counting the occurrences of each number in an array and determining whether those counts can be used to achieve the goal under given constraints (using two operations or three). The solution requires a methodical approach that considers all cases, especially edge cases like when frequencies cannot lead to emptying the array according to rules.

### Conclusion:
Based on these factors, this problem could be categorized as **MEDIUM** difficulty within Algorithm Design. It requires a good understanding of data structures, efficient computation techniques, and careful consideration of boundary conditions. Mastery of these aspects helps in crafting an optimal solution that is both correct and performs well with large inputs.
