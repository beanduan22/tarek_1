Problem ID: 2998
Problem Content:
You are given two positive integers low and high.
An integer x consisting of 2 * n digits is symmetric if the sum of the first n digits of x is equal to the sum of the last n digits of x. Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric.
Return the number of symmetric integers in the range [low, high].
 
Example 1:

Input: low = 1, high = 100
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 symmetric integers between 1 and 100: 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.

Example 2:

Input: low = 1200, high = 1230
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 symmetric integers between 1200 and 1230: 1203, 1212, 1221, and 1230.

 
Constraints:

1 <= low <= high <= 10^4

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem falls under the category of "Medium" level problems. It involves understanding basic number manipulation and logical operations with a certain level of complexity in terms of constraints (the numbers are limited to four digits).

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Number Manipulation:** You need skills to parse and manipulate integers, especially multi-digit numbers.
2. **Logical Reasoning:** Understanding the problem statement requires careful reasoning about digit sums and their symmetry.
3. **Iteration over a Range:** The problem involves iterating through a range of integers from `low` to `high`.
4. **Conditional Logic:** Implementing logic that checks for symmetric integers based on the criteria described.

**Problem Complexity:**
1. **Time Complexity:** Since you have to iterate from low to high, checking each integer for symmetry, this could potentially be O(n), where n is the difference between `high` and `low`. However, since we are dealing with numbers up to four digits here, it's more efficient than a simple linear search in larger number ranges.
2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity would typically depend on any additional storage needed besides input/output data structures. In this case, assuming basic variable usage for counting symmetric integers and possibly storing sums of digit groups, the space complexity could be considered O(1) since it does not grow with the size of `low` or `high`.

The problem requires careful algorithm design to efficiently check each number within the given range without unnecessary computation. The constraint of limiting numbers up to four digits also makes this problem relatively straightforward compared to larger constraints, thus classifying it as a "Medium" difficulty level problem in terms of complexity and required skill set.
