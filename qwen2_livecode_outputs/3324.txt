Problem ID: 3324
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums of even length. You have to split the array into two parts nums1 and nums2 such that:

nums1.length == nums2.length == nums.length / 2.
nums1 should contain distinct elements.
nums2 should also contain distinct elements.

Return true if it is possible to split the array, and false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,3,4]
Output: true
Explanation: One of the possible ways to split nums is nums1 = [1,2,3] and nums2 = [1,2,4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: false
Explanation: The only possible way to split nums is nums1 = [1,1] and nums2 = [1,1]. Both nums1 and nums2 do not contain distinct elements. Therefore, we return false.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
nums.length % 2 == 0 
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem is a relatively straightforward one that requires understanding of array manipulation and basic data structures. It does not require advanced knowledge such as recursion, complex algorithms like dynamic programming or graph theory, nor does it involve high-level abstractions found in more sophisticated programming languages.

In terms of difficulty:

- **Beginner to Intermediate** Problem: The problem is suitable for beginners who are familiar with the basic concepts of array manipulation and data structures but might require some practice to handle edge cases effectively.
  
Required Programming Skills:

- **Array Manipulation**: Ability to traverse arrays, modify them based on certain conditions.
- **Basic Data Structures**: Understanding of hash maps or hash sets which could be used here for storing unique elements.

Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The main operations are traversals through the array and using a set (or map) which generally has an average time complexity of O(1) per operation. Hence, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n), where n is the size of the input array.
  
- **Space Complexity**: Additional space required for storing unique elements depends on the number of unique elements in the array and could go up to O(n).

To summarize:

This problem falls under the category of **"Basic Data Structures and Algorithms"**, specifically focusing on understanding and manipulating arrays, using data structures like hash maps or sets to ensure distinct elements, and analyzing the constraints given for optimizing solutions. It is suitable as an interview question for junior-level software developers testing their grasp of basic programming concepts.

The difficulty level might vary slightly depending on the developer's familiarity with these concepts, but generally speaking, it should be considered a medium-to-easy problem in terms of complexity.
