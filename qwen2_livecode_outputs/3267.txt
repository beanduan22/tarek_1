Problem ID: 3267
Problem Content:
You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.
A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.
Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "aa": substrings "aaaa", "aaaa", and "aaaa".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcdef"
Output: -1
Explanation: There exists no special substring which occurs at least thrice. Hence return -1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "abcaba"
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest special substring which occurs thrice is "a": substrings "abcaba", "abcaba", and "abcaba".
It can be shown that the maximum length achievable is 1.

 
Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 50
s consists of only lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem presented above involves string manipulation and searching for specific patterns within a given string. The task includes checking all possible substrings, which makes this problem relatively straightforward yet demanding due to the need for careful implementation.

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Required Programming Skills**:
1. **String Manipulation**: Understanding how to efficiently extract substrings from a larger string.
2. **Sliding Window Technique or Brute Force**: Implementing either technique to check all possible substrings (or using a more optimized approach).
3. **Counting and Tracking**: Keeping track of the frequency of special substrings that meet specific criteria.

**Time Complexity**: The straightforward brute-force solution involves iterating through every substring, which could take O(n^3) time complexity considering each substring length from 1 to n (where n is the length of s). However, an optimized approach can bring this down based on how efficiently we handle frequency checks.

**Space Complexity**: Assuming the use of a dictionary or hash map for storing and retrieving character frequencies, which might contribute O(n) space complexity due to possible storage of all unique characters in the string.

Given these details, the problem is most suitable for an intermediate-level programming challenge that requires understanding and applying string manipulation techniques effectively. It's also designed to assess one's ability to optimize algorithms when dealing with problems that involve searching through multiple instances within a larger dataset (in this case, substrings of a string).
