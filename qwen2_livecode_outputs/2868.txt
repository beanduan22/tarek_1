Problem ID: 2868
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A subarray of nums is called continuous if:

Let i, i + 1, ..., j_ be the indices in the subarray. Then, for each pair of indices i <= i_1, i_2 <= j, 0 <= |nums[i_1] - nums[i_2]| <= 2.

Return the total number of continuous subarrays.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,4,2,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: 
Continuous subarray of size 1: [5], [4], [2], [4].
Continuous subarray of size 2: [5,4], [4,2], [2,4].
Continuous subarray of size 3: [4,2,4].
Thereare no subarrys of size 4.
Total continuous subarrays = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8.
It can be shown that there are no more continuous subarrays.

 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
Continuous subarray of size 1: [1], [2], [3].
Continuous subarray of size 2: [1,2], [2,3].
Continuous subarray of size 3: [1,2,3].
Total continuous subarrays = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem presented above can be categorized as follows:

**Category:** **Algorithm - Dynamic Programming/Sliding Window**

**Difficulty Level:** **Medium**

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Understanding of Array Manipulation:** The ability to traverse an array and perform operations on its elements efficiently.
2. **Data Structures:** Usage of a data structure (like a set) to keep track of recent values while ensuring they are within the specified range from the current element in the subarray.
3. **Sliding Window Technique:** This problem requires implementing a sliding window concept, where we maintain a window of elements that satisfy certain conditions and incrementally move this window across the array.

**Algorithmic Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm will iterate through each element of the input array once while maintaining some form of data structure to store recent values. The overall complexity could be O(N) as we perform constant time operations per element.
- **Space Complexity:** The space required would depend on how large this data structure grows in relation to N (the length of nums). For an efficient solution, using a sliding window technique, the extra space used can be O(1), assuming the underlying set implementation uses optimizations for memory usage.

**Solving Strategy:**
The problem requires identifying continuous subarrays that meet specific conditions. The strategy would involve iterating through each element while maintaining a set of valid preceding elements and checking if adding the current element still keeps the array within the specified condition's range.

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Dynamic Maintenance:** Keep track of recent values effectively using data structures like sets or sliding windows.
2. **Conditional Checking:** Efficiently check for conditions on the fly (in this case, maintaining a small gap between elements).
3. **Algorithmic Thinking:** Understanding how to apply techniques like sliding window logic to solve problems related to array manipulation.

By solving such problems, one can improve their skills in algorithm design and data structure usage, particularly focusing on optimization strategies for time complexity while managing memory efficiently.
