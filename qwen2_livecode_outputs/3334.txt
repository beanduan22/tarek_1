Problem ID: 3334
Problem Content:
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.
There are n packs where the i^th pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the i^th box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.
Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.
Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.
 
Example 1:

Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.
It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.

Example 2:

Input: apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We will need to use all the boxes.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == apple.length <= 50
1 <= m == capacity.length <= 50
1 <= apple[i], capacity[i] <= 50
The input is generated such that it's possible to redistribute packs of apples into boxes.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Category: Medium Difficulty Problem

Required Programming Skills:

1. Array manipulation (creation, iteration)
2. Sorting algorithms (especially for optimization purposes)
3. Basic understanding of space and time complexities
4. Mathematical operations such as addition and comparison 

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n log n + m), where n is the length of 'apple' array and m is the length of 'capacity' array due to sorting.
Space Complexity: O(1) since we are using only a few extra variables (like sum, min_boxes). The space complexity does not depend on input size.

The problem requires you to find out how many boxes are needed based on different capacities to distribute apples. This typically involves sorting the capacity array in descending order and then checking if each pack of apples can fit into these sorted boxes until all packs are placed or determining that every box is used (i.e., minimum number of boxes required equals total number of boxes). 

It's a bit tricky because it combines multiple concepts but doesn't require complex algorithms. Therefore, I would classify this as a medium difficulty problem.

For someone proficient in coding and array manipulation, they can easily write the code to solve this question by following the steps mentioned above:

1. Sort both arrays.
2. Start from the largest capacity box (as it's more likely that larger boxes could fit smaller packs of apples).
3. If an apple pack doesn't fit into any existing boxes yet, increment your count of minimum boxes required.

This approach will ensure they efficiently use resources while handling all possible edge cases and constraints provided in the problem statement.
