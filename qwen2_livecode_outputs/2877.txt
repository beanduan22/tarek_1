Problem ID: 2877
Problem Content:
Given three strings a, b, and c, your task is to find a string that has the minimum length and contains all three strings as substrings.
If there are multiple such strings, return the lexicographically smallest one.
Return a string denoting the answer to the problem.
Notes

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 
Example 1:

Input: a = "abc", b = "bca", c = "aaa"
Output: "aaabca"
Explanation:  We show that "aaabca" contains all the given strings: a = ans[2...4], b = ans[3..5], c = ans[0..2]. It can be shown that the length of the resulting string would be at least 6 and "aaabca" is the lexicographically smallest one.
Example 2:

Input: a = "ab", b = "ba", c = "aba"
Output: "aba"
Explanation: We show that the string "aba" contains all the given strings: a = ans[0..1], b = ans[1..2], c = ans[0..2]. Since the length of c is 3, the length of the resulting string would be at least 3. It can be shown that "aba" is the lexicographically smallest one.

 
Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length, c.length <= 100
a, b, c consist only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the given details about this programming problem:

- It involves string manipulation, a common topic in algorithmic challenges requiring knowledge of string handling operations like substrings, concatenation, etc. 

- The problem description mentions analyzing different possible solutions (minimizing length or lexicographically smallest solution), which often hints at dynamic programming or greedy approaches being involved as the solution strategies.

- It requires understanding concepts such as comparing strings and character ordering, which are fundamental topics in computer science and programming.

- There is no indication of high computational complexity based on the problem description. The constraints (length <= 100) are relatively small, suggesting that a brute-force approach might be feasible or at least manageable for most candidates.

Considering these points:

Category Prediction:
This problem would likely fall into one of two main categories in programming problems based on difficulty and skills required:

1. **Intermediate Level**: This indicates the need to understand string manipulation techniques, dynamic programming concepts (as suggested by solution strategies), and be able to efficiently compare strings in terms of their order or properties like length. Candidates are expected to write clean code that handles edge cases well.

2. **Advanced Level**: If the problem also requires optimization techniques beyond basic algorithmic knowledge, such as implementing an efficient algorithm that performs better than brute-force (e.g., by finding patterns in string overlaps), it could be considered more advanced due to the need for deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms.

Given these considerations, this problem likely targets candidates with intermediate programming skills who are comfortable working with strings and have experience with dynamic programming or optimization techniques. The expected solutions would involve identifying common substrings between the given strings in an efficient manner to construct the final answer string while ensuring it meets the specified conditions of being as short as possible (and lexicographically smallest if length is equal).

Therefore, this problem can be categorized under **Intermediate Level Programming Problem**, focusing on skills like:
- Basic knowledge of string operations
- Understanding and application of greedy algorithms or dynamic programming for optimization 
- Ability to write clean and efficient code that adheres to constraints.
