Problem ID: 2754
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums representing the score of students in an exam. The teacher would like to form one non-empty group of students with maximal strength, where the strength of a group of students of indices i_0, i_1, i_2, ... , i_k is defined as nums[i_0] * nums[i_1] * nums[i_2] * ... * nums[i_k​].
Return the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,-1,-5,2,5,-9]
Output: 1350
Explanation: One way to form a group of maximal strength is to group the students at indices [0,2,3,4,5]. Their strength is 3 * (-5) * 2 * 5 * (-9) = 1350, which we can show is optimal.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-4,-5,-4]
Output: 20
Explanation: Group the students at indices [0, 1] . Then, we’ll have a resulting strength of 20. We cannot achieve greater strength.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 13
-9 <= nums[i] <= 9

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the problem description and constraints provided, we can analyze it as follows:

1. **Problem Complexity**: The problem involves finding the maximum strength of a group given certain constraints (non-empty group and maximizing product of scores). It also mentions that brute force or naive approaches might be considered but are not optimal due to time complexity concerns.

2. **Required Skills**: To solve this problem, you'll need proficiency in:
   - Basic programming skills: loops, arrays
   - Algorithmic thinking: understanding and applying greedy algorithm strategy
   - Handling floating-point numbers (if required for optimization calculations)

3. **Category Prediction**:
   - **Difficulty Level**: Medium to Hard. The solution requires efficient handling of multiple factors (scores in an array), which is beyond simple brute-force approaches that would be time-consuming due to the array's size constraint.
   - **Required Programming Skills**: Implementation skills, algorithmic optimization abilities.
   - **Complexity**:
     - Time Complexity: The solution should aim for at least O(N log N) or better to handle arrays of up to 13 elements efficiently. A naive brute-force approach would be too slow (O(N^N)).
     - Space Complexity: The space complexity can vary depending on whether sorting is needed but it typically doesn't exceed O(log N) with the most efficient algorithms.

**Category Prediction**: This problem seems best categorized under **Algorithm Design and Analysis**, particularly focusing on optimization techniques. It leans more towards **Advanced Algorithms** as it requires deeper understanding of how to efficiently compute products given certain constraints rather than just brute-forcing through all possibilities. The use of sorting or specific mathematical insights (like handling negative numbers) indicates a step beyond basic programming tasks, making this suitable for interviews or advanced algorithmic challenges.
