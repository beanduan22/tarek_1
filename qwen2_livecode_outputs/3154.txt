Problem ID: 3154
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
Return the maximum value over all triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that i < j < k. If all such triplets have a negative value, return 0.
The value of a triplet of indices (i, j, k) is equal to (nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k].
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [12,6,1,2,7]
Output: 77
Explanation: The value of the triplet (0, 2, 4) is (nums[0] - nums[2]) * nums[4] = 77.
It can be shown that there are no ordered triplets of indices with a value greater than 77. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,10,3,4,19]
Output: 133
Explanation: The value of the triplet (1, 2, 4) is (nums[1] - nums[2]) * nums[4] = 133.
It can be shown that there are no ordered triplets of indices with a value greater than 133.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The only ordered triplet of indices (0, 1, 2) has a negative value of (nums[0] - nums[1]) * nums[2] = -3. Hence, the answer would be 0.

 
Constraints:

3 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem is a combination of array manipulation and comparison logic with some mathematical operations. 

**Category Prediction:**
- **Difficulty:** Medium to High - The problem requires understanding how to traverse an array in multiple passes efficiently while keeping track of maximum possible values.
- **Required Programming Skills:** 
  - Basic programming skills (knowing how to loop through arrays, use conditional statements)
  - Experience with mathematical operations on integers
  - Ability to think about the ordering of elements in an array (i.e., understanding indices and their implications)
- **Complexity:**
  - Time Complexity: The problem can be solved in O(n^2) time complexity due to two nested loops for finding triplets.
  - Space Complexity: O(1) since only a constant amount of extra space is used.

**Approach Prediction:**
To solve this problem, you will likely need to:
- Iterate through the array to generate all possible triplets (i, j, k)
- For each triplet, calculate its value using `(nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k]`
- Keep track of the maximum value found during the iterations

**Solution Strategy:**
1. Initialize a variable `max_value` to 0 before starting the loop.
2. Use three nested loops with indices i, j, and k such that i < j < k.
3. For each triplet (i, j, k), calculate its value `(nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k]`.
4. Compare this value with `max_value` to update `max_value` if it's greater than the current max.
5. Return `max_value` after all triplets have been considered.

**Note on Optimizations:**
Given the constraints (3 <= len(nums) <= 100), the brute force approach is feasible as this is a small input size compared to problems requiring more complex algorithms like dynamic programming or graph theory, etc. However, the use of nested loops inherently limits efficiency; in larger arrays with more stringent time complexity requirements, considering optimizations might be necessary.

**Code Implementation (pseudo code)**:
```
function max_triplet_value(nums) {
    let max_value = 0;
    for i = 0 to length(nums)-2 do
        for j = i+1 to length(nums)-1 do 
            for k = j+1 to length(nums)-1 do {
                triplet_value = (nums[i] - nums[j]) * nums[k];
                if triplet_value > max_value then
                    max_value = triplet_value;
            }
    end loop
end function

main() {
    nums = input array
    print max_triplet_value(nums)
}
```

This code provides a clear pseudo-code that can be translated into any programming language following the logic described.
