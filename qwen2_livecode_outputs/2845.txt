Problem ID: 2845
Problem Content:
You are given a positive integer array nums.
Partition nums into two arrays, nums1 and nums2, such that:

Each element of the array nums belongs to either the array nums1 or the array nums2.
Both arrays are non-empty.
The value of the partition is minimized.

The value of the partition is |max(nums1) - min(nums2)|.
Here, max(nums1) denotes the maximum element of the array nums1, and min(nums2) denotes the minimum element of the array nums2.
Return the integer denoting the value of such partition.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can partition the array nums into nums1 = [1,2] and nums2 = [3,4].
- The maximum element of the array nums1 is equal to 2.
- The minimum element of the array nums2 is equal to 3.
The value of the partition is |2 - 3| = 1. 
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum value out of all partitions.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [100,1,10]
Output: 9
Explanation: We can partition the array nums into nums1 = [10] and nums2 = [100,1].
- The maximum element of the array nums1 is equal to 10.
- The minimum element of the array nums2 is equal to 1.
The value of the partition is |10 - 1| = 9.
It can be proven that 9 is the minimum value out of all partitions.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the given problem statement, we can categorize it as follows:

**Category:** Algorithms - Dynamic Programming

**Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Understanding of Sorting:** The solution heavily depends on sorting the input array to find an optimal partition that minimizes the difference between the maximum element in one subarray and the minimum element in another.
2. **Efficient Implementation:** Since there's a constraint on the size of the array (up to 10^5 elements), the solution needs to be efficient, possibly using sorting techniques which have time complexity better than O(n log n) for large arrays.

**Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: The primary operation involves sorting the array. Most common sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort have a time complexity of O(n log n). For this problem, we can use an in-place sorting algorithm such as Heap Sort to optimize slightly for space usage.
- Space Complexity: The space required is dominated by the input itself (O(n)) and auxiliary storage used by the sort function. Algorithms like Heap Sort require additional space that depends on the implementation.

**Explanation of Solution Process:**
1. **Sort the Array:** First, sorting the array allows us to easily explore partitions between elements.
2. **Explore Partitions:** Iterate through the sorted array, considering each element as a possible maximum in one partition and minimum in another partition. Compute the difference between the current element (potential max) and the smallest element found so far for every partition.
3. **Find Minimum Value:** Keep track of the minimum value encountered during this process.

**Overall:**
This problem falls under dynamic programming concepts indirectly through an iterative approach that explores partitions to minimize a specific metric (the absolute difference between maximum in one part and minimum in another). It requires a good understanding of sorting algorithms, optimization techniques for large inputs, and careful algorithm design considering time complexity constraints.
