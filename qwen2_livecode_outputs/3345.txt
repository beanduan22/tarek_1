Problem ID: 3345
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums of length n and a positive integer k.
The power of an array of integers is defined as the number of subsequences with their sum equal to k.
Return the sum of power of all subsequences of nums.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 
Output:   6 
Explanation:
There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 3: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].

Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Example 2:

Input:   nums = [2,3,3], k = 5 
Output:   4 
Explanation:
There are 3 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [2,3,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 5: [2,3,3] and [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].
The subsequence [2,3,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 5: [2,3,3].

Hence the answer is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

Example 3:

Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 7 
Output:   0 
Explanation: There exists no subsequence with sum 7. Hence all subsequences of nums have power = 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
1 <= k <= 100

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the details provided about this programming problem, we can analyze it and categorize it as follows:

**Difficulty Level:** Medium to High. The problem involves understanding subsequences, their sums, and power calculations, which are common in algorithmic challenges but require careful consideration of edge cases and optimization for large input sizes.

**Required Programming Skills:** This problem requires skills in dynamic programming or combinatorics (to calculate the sum based on given conditions), as well as proficiency with array manipulation and mathematical operations. Knowledge of modular arithmetic would also be helpful due to the requirement of outputting results modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** The straightforward approach involves iterating over all possible subsequences, which has a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is the length of the input array. However, optimizations can be made using dynamic programming or combinatorial techniques to achieve better performance.
  
- **Space Complexity:** An optimal solution might require storing intermediate results in arrays or additional data structures, leading to space complexities ranging from O(n) for a straightforward approach to potentially optimized solutions that could operate closer to constant space complexity.

In summary, this problem combines elements of algorithm design and combinatorics with the need for efficient computation. It tests one's understanding of these concepts and ability to optimize algorithms for performance while adhering to constraints on output size.
