Problem ID: abc343_a
Problem Content:
You are given two integers A and B, each between 0 and 9, inclusive.
Print any integer between 0 and 9, inclusive, that is not equal to A + B.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

Print any integer between 0 and 9, inclusive, that is not equal to A + B.

Constraints


- 0 \leq A \leq 9
- 0 \leq B \leq 9
- A + B \leq 9
- A and B are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 5

Sample Output 1

2

When A = 2, B = 5, we have A + B = 7. Thus, printing any of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 is correct.

Sample Input 2

0 0

Sample Output 2

9

Sample Input 3

7 1

Sample Output 3

4

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem falls into the category of "Easy" with respect to difficulty. This categorization is based on several factors:

### Difficulty Level:
- **Logical Reasoning**: The task primarily involves logical reasoning rather than complex algorithms or data structures. Participants need to understand the constraints and apply basic arithmetic operations.
- **Code Implementation**: It does not require advanced programming techniques beyond basic syntax knowledge in most languages, making it accessible even to beginners.

### Required Programming Skills:
- **Basic Syntax**: Familiarity with the syntax of at least one programming language is needed. Basic understanding of variables, input/output operations, and simple arithmetic expressions are sufficient.
- **Conditional Logic**: Knowledge of if-statements or conditional logic is necessary to determine whether a number should be printed based on its comparison with `A + B`.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves reading two numbers as input and printing an output, which can usually be done in constant time (O(1)).
- **Space Complexity**: Similarly, the memory usage does not depend on the size of the input but rather on fixed variables or stack space for function calls.

Given these factors, this problem would typically be found in introductory programming challenges designed to help beginners understand basic control structures and arithmetic operations. It is a good starting point for those learning to code as it balances simplicity with just enough challenge to encourage critical thinking about numbers and programming logic.
