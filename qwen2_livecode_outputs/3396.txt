Problem ID: 3396
Problem Content:
A word is considered valid if:

It contains a minimum of 3 characters.
It contains only digits (0-9), and English letters (uppercase and lowercase).
It includes at least one vowel.
It includes at least one consonant.

You are given a string word.
Return true if word is valid, otherwise, return false.
Notes:

'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercases are vowels.
A consonant is an English letter that is not a vowel.

 
Example 1:

Input: word = "234Adas"
Output: true
Explanation:
This word satisfies the conditions.

Example 2:

Input: word = "b3"
Output: false
Explanation:
The length of this word is fewer than 3, and does not have a vowel.

Example 3:

Input: word = "a3$e"
Output: false
Explanation:
This word contains a '$' character and does not have a consonant.

 
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 20
word consists of English uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, '@', '#', and '$'.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The programming problem described above involves validating a string based on certain rules. Let's analyze it:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Objective**: Determine if a given string `word` meets specific criteria to be considered "valid".
2. **Rules**:
   - The string must have at least 3 characters.
   - It should consist solely of digits (0-9) and English letters (`A-Z`, `a-z`).
   - It must contain at least one vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`) in both uppercase and lowercase forms.
   - It must also include at least one consonant.

### Complexity

**Time Complexity**: The problem involves iterating through the string once to check each condition. This leads to a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input `word`.

**Space Complexity**: No additional data structures are required beyond what's used for inputs and outputs, so the space complexity would be O(1) if we ignore the output storage.

### Required Programming Skills

- **String manipulation**: To check individual characters in the string.
- **Character classification**: Differentiating between letters (including uppercase), digits, vowels, and consonants.
- **Condition evaluation**: Implementing logic based on multiple conditions being met simultaneously or sequentially.

### Problem Category Prediction

Based on these characteristics:

- **Difficulty Level**: The problem is relatively straightforward with clear requirements and a linear time complexity. It would be considered an "Easy" level problem for beginners who are familiar with basic string manipulation and condition evaluation in their programming language of choice.
- **Required Skills**: Basic knowledge of character classification (vowels, consonants) and familiarity with loops and conditional statements to process each character or segment of the input string.
- **Complexity**: The solution involves a simple set of checks that can be implemented using straightforward logic and no complex algorithms.

In conclusion, this problem falls under the category of "Easy" level problems, focusing on fundamental programming skills such as string processing and basic conditional logic.
