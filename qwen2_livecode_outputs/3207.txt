Problem ID: 3207
Problem Content:
You are given three strings s1, s2, and s3. You have to perform the following operation on these three strings as many times as you want.
In one operation you can choose one of these three strings such that its length is at least 2 and delete the rightmost character of it.
Return the minimum number of operations you need to perform to make the three strings equal if there is a way to make them equal, otherwise, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "abb", s3 = "ab"
Output: 2
Explanation: Performing operations on s1 and s2 once will lead to three equal strings.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them equal with less than two operations.
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "dac", s2 = "bac", s3 = "cac"
Output: -1
Explanation: Because the leftmost letters of s1 and s2 are not equal, they could not be equal after any number of operations. So the answer is -1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s1.length, s2.length, s3.length <= 100
s1, s2 and s3 consist only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided, this problem involves understanding string manipulation and potentially dealing with recursion or dynamic programming due to the process requiring operations that can be performed multiple times until a certain condition is met. The task involves comparing strings, manipulating them by deleting characters from their ends, and finding minimum number of operations required under specific conditions.

Given these factors:

1. **Difficulty Level**: This falls in the intermediate to advanced range depending on how the problem is approached. It requires understanding of string manipulation techniques such as deletion of characters and handling of conditional logic based on string equality.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: The solution will likely require familiarity with basic programming constructs (like loops, conditionals), knowledge of strings manipulation libraries or functions in your chosen language, and possibly recursion for exploring all possible ways to minimize operations.

3. **Complexity**: In terms of time complexity, this problem could potentially involve multiple iterations through the string lengths during recursive calls or a more optimized approach using dynamic programming if not handled carefully might lead to exponential time complexity due to its nature of trying out different operations on strings repeatedly until an optimal solution is found. Space complexity would largely depend on recursion stack depth.

Based on these factors, I'd categorize this problem as **Intermediate - Advanced** difficulty level requiring skills in string manipulation and potentially either recursion or dynamic programming strategies for solving it efficiently. It tests not only the ability to understand and apply basic programming techniques but also the ability to approach problems methodically and optimize solutions based on constraints provided.
