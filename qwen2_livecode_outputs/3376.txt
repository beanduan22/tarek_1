Problem ID: 3376
Problem Content:
You are given two arrays of strings wordsContainer and wordsQuery.
For each wordsQuery[i], you need to find a string from wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i]. If there are two or more strings in wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in wordsContainer.
Return an array of integers ans, where ans[i] is the index of the string in wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: wordsContainer = ["abcd","bcd","xbcd"], wordsQuery = ["cd","bcd","xyz"]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "cd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "cd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[1] = "bcd", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "bcd" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[2] = "xyz", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is "", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.


Example 2:

Input: wordsContainer = ["abcdefgh","poiuygh","ghghgh"], wordsQuery = ["gh","acbfgh","acbfegh"]
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = "gh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.
For wordsQuery[1] = "acbfgh", only the string at index 0 shares the longest common suffix "fgh". Hence it is the answer, even though the string at index 2 is shorter.
For wordsQuery[2] = "acbfegh", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix "gh" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.


 
Constraints:

1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 10^4
1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 10^3
1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 10^3
wordsContainer[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
wordsQuery[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.
Sum of wordsContainer[i].length is at most 5 * 10^5.
Sum of wordsQuery[i].length is at most 5 * 10^5.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem involves string manipulation and data structure operations. The primary task is to find common suffixes between query strings (wordsQuery) and words from a container array (wordsContainer). Based on this description:

1. **Required Programming Skills**: 
   - String Manipulation: Understanding of suffixes, substring extraction, etc.
   - Data Structure Usage: Efficient way of storing and searching for suffixes to optimize time complexity.

2. **Difficulty Level**:
   - The problem requires efficient algorithms that can handle large input sizes (up to \(5 \times 10^5\)). Therefore, it leans towards being somewhat difficult due to the constraints on string lengths and the potential for multiple similar solutions.
   
3. **Problem Complexity**:
   - Time Complexity: While brute force might come to mind (compare each query with all words in container), such an approach would have a time complexity of \(O(n \times m)\) where \(n\) is the number of strings in `wordsContainer` and \(m\) is the maximum length of any string. This won't be efficient enough given the input constraints, leading to need for optimizations.
   - Space Complexity: The space complexity could vary depending on how suffixes are stored during preprocessing or searching stages.

Considering these aspects:

The problem category would likely fall under **Algorithms** and **String Processing**, with a focus on **Efficient String Search Techniques** (like trying out something akin to reverse lookup using suffix arrays or similar data structures optimized for this purpose). This is because it requires sophisticated string handling while keeping the algorithmic efficiency in mind. The problem might also touch upon **Data Structures**, particularly in how efficiently one can store and look up common suffixes.

In summary, a good categorization for this problem could be within **Intermediate Algorithm Design Problems** involving String Processing and Efficient Data Structures, given its balance of complexity requiring careful algorithm design but not being overly complex to the point where it introduces advanced concepts like dynamic programming or graph theory.
