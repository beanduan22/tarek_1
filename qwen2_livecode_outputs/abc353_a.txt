Problem ID: abc353_a
Problem Content:
There are N buildings aligned in a row. The i-th building from the left has a height of H_i.
Determine if there is a building taller than the first one from the left. If such a building exists, find the position of the leftmost such building from the left.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
H_1 H_2 \ldots H_N

Output

If no building is taller than the first one from the left, print -1.
If such a building exists, print the position (index) of the leftmost such building from the left.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- 1 \leq H_i \leq 100
- All input values are integers.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the given information about the problem:

1. **Difficulty**: This question involves basic array traversal, comparison operations, and conditional checks. These are fundamental concepts that a beginner programmer should understand.

2. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - **Looping through arrays**: To iterate over all buildings to compare their heights.
   - **Conditional checking**: To determine if any building is taller than the first one from the left.
   - **Basic arithmetic operations**: For calculating the position of the tallest building, which requires understanding array indexing.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of buildings. This occurs because we have to check every single building once.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1), as there are no additional data structures needed that scale with input size.

4. **Problem Category**: The problem falls under basic array manipulation and conditional logic, which could be categorized into "Basics" or "Introduction to Arrays" in a course curriculum. It is designed primarily for beginners who have just started learning programming and need exercises focused on understanding control flow statements (loops and conditionals) as well as simple data structures like arrays.

The solution approach would involve iterating through the array of building heights while keeping track of the tallest height encountered and its index. If a taller building is found, this information is updated immediately. After completing the iteration, based on whether the maximum height has been updated (indicated by an index different from `-1`), or not (`-1`), provides the answer to where the tallest building is located relative to the first one.

In summary, this problem tests fundamental programming skills with a straightforward and practical application. It doesn't delve into complex algorithms or data structures but focuses on essential concepts that are crucial for beginners in computer science education.
