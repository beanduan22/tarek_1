Problem ID: 3364
Problem Content:
You are given two arrays nums and andValues of length n and m respectively.
The value of an array is equal to the last element of that array.
You have to divide nums into m disjoint contiguous subarrays such that for the i^th subarray [l_i, r_i], the bitwise AND of the subarray elements is equal to andValues[i], in other words, nums[l_i] & nums[l_i + 1] & ... & nums[r_i] == andValues[i] for all 1 <= i <= m, where & represents the bitwise AND operator.
Return the minimum possible sum of the values of the m subarrays nums is divided into. If it is not possible to divide nums into m subarrays satisfying these conditions, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2], andValues = [0,3,3,2]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The only possible way to divide nums is:

[1,4] as 1 & 4 == 0.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[2] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.

The sum of the values for these subarrays is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,7,7,5], andValues = [0,7,5]
Output: 17
Explanation:
There are three ways to divide nums:

[[2,3,5],[7,7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 5 + 7 + 5 == 17.
[[2,3,5,7],[7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.
[[2,3,5,7,7],[7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.

The minimum possible sum of the values is 17.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], andValues = [2]
Output: -1
Explanation:
The bitwise AND of the entire array nums is 0. As there is no possible way to divide nums into a single subarray to have the bitwise AND of elements 2, return -1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 10^4
1 <= m == andValues.length <= min(n, 10)
1 <= nums[i] < 10^5
0 <= andValues[j] < 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
The programming problem described here can be categorized as an "Algorithm" or a "Dynamic Programming" problem. 

**Category: Algorithm**

* **Difficulty:** This problem is of moderate to high difficulty depending on one's familiarity with specific concepts in algorithms, such as dynamic programming, array manipulation, and bit operations.

* **Required Skills:** The problem requires knowledge about how to manipulate arrays and perform bitwise AND operations efficiently. Familiarity with dynamic programming techniques would be advantageous for finding the minimum possible sum of subarrays' values.

* **Complexity:** The complexity comes from determining an efficient way to calculate all possible combinations of subarrays that satisfy the given conditions, which hints at a potential need for exploring different states in dynamic programming or using backtracking.

**Category: Dynamic Programming**

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming because it involves finding an optimal solution (minimum sum) by making decisions based on previous subproblems. The state transition might involve deciding whether to include the current element in the same subarray with a previous one that has already been chosen or starting a new subarray, which depends on bitwise AND operations.

The key elements of dynamic programming like states, transitions, and optimization techniques are crucial for developing an effective solution strategy here.

In summary:
- **Algorithm:** It's suitable for someone looking to enhance their skills in handling array manipulations and bit-level operations.
- **Dynamic Programming:** This is beneficial for those who wish to improve their problem-solving abilities with decision-making processes under constraints. The dynamic programming approach offers a systematic way to explore all possible subarray combinations efficiently while ensuring the best solution found meets specific criteria.

To solve this problem, one might consider implementing a dynamic programming approach that keeps track of previously calculated optimal sums and uses them in making decisions for larger problems (subarrays). At each step, the algorithm would need to evaluate whether adding the current element to an existing subarray can satisfy the condition or if starting a new subarray with the current element is more beneficial based on its value compared to potential values required by subsequent elements.
