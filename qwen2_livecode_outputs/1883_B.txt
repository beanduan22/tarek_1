Problem ID: 1883_B
Problem Content:
You are given a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and an integer $k$.

You need to check if it is possible to remove exactly $k$ characters from the string $s$ in such a way that the remaining characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome. Note that you can reorder the remaining characters in any way.

A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, the strings "z", "aaa", "aba", "abccba" are palindromes, while the strings "codeforces", "reality", "ab" are not.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of the test cases. This is followed by their description.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($0 \leq k < n \leq 10^5$) — the length of the string $s$ and the number of characters to be deleted.

The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to remove exactly $k$ characters from the string $s$ in such a way that the remaining characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (uppercase or lowercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.Sample Input 1:

Note

In the first test case, nothing can be removed, and the string "a" is a palindrome.

In the second test case, nothing can be removed, but the strings "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes.

In the third test case, any character can be removed, and the resulting string will be a palindrome.

In the fourth test case, one occurrence of the character "a" can be removed, resulting in the string "bb", which is a palindrome.

In the sixth test case, one occurrence of the characters "b" and "d" can be removed, resulting in the string "acac", which can be rearranged to the string "acca".

In the ninth test case, one occurrence of the characters "t" and "k" can be removed, resulting in the string "aagaa", which is a palindrome.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The provided programming problem involves several key aspects related to algorithms, strings manipulation, and logic. Based on the characteristics outlined, I would categorize this problem as follows:

### Difficulty Level:
**Medium to Hard**
- It requires a good understanding of string handling techniques, specifically working with characters and counting occurrences.
- The logical reasoning needed for determining whether it is possible to form a palindrome after removing exactly `k` characters might be challenging if not approached correctly.

### Required Programming Skills:
1. **String Manipulation**: Efficiently handling strings through operations like concatenation, slicing, or iterating over elements.
2. **Character Frequency Counting**: Keeping track of the frequency or count of each character in the string is crucial for determining the possibility of forming a palindrome.
3. **Conditional Logic**: Implementing conditional statements to make decisions based on character counts and removal constraints.

### Complexity:
1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The primary complexity comes from iterating through the string, which can be done in linear time (`O(n)`).
   - Additional operations such as counting character frequencies also contribute to the overall time complexity but are usually `O(n)` or better due to modern data structures.

2. **Space Complexity**: 
   - Minimal space complexity is expected since the problem does not require storing all permutations of characters after removals, and typically only requires keeping track of frequency counts which can be managed efficiently with a hash map (`O(n)` in the worst case).

### Algorithmic Approach:
- The core algorithm involves counting character frequencies to understand if it's possible to balance out each half of a string to form a palindrome. For this purpose, characters appearing an even number of times do not affect the palindrome formation, while those appearing odd numbers might require one extra count beyond `k` removals for potential palindromes.
- The problem essentially tests whether the total number of odd-frequency characters minus `k` is non-negative and does not exceed half the string length (`n/2`). This ensures that after removing `k` characters, an even number of characters can be placed symmetrically around a middle point (if necessary).

### Conclusion:
The programming problem combines fundamental aspects of algorithmic thinking with practical string handling tasks. It requires careful consideration of character frequency distribution and logical decision-making to determine the feasibility of palindrome formation under specific constraints.

To solve this problem effectively, one would need an algorithm that efficiently counts character occurrences and checks against the removal criteria (`k`). Techniques such as using a hash map for character frequency counting can help manage resources well while ensuring timely processing of inputs.

This categorization highlights the educational value in learning how to manipulate strings dynamically and how to reason about the theoretical constraints necessary for forming specific patterns like palindromes through programmatic solutions.
