Problem ID: 2819
Problem Content:
Given a positive integer num represented as a string, return the integer num without trailing zeros as a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = "51230100"
Output: "512301"
Explanation: Integer "51230100" has 2 trailing zeros, we remove them and return integer "512301".

Example 2:

Input: num = "123"
Output: "123"
Explanation: Integer "123" has no trailing zeros, we return integer "123".

 
Constraints:

1 <= num.length <= 1000
num consists of only digits.
num doesn't have any leading zeros.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This is a relatively simple problem that tests basic string manipulation skills. The main focus here is understanding how to iterate over or traverse a string in reverse order to find trailing characters (in this case, zeros). It requires knowledge of programming concepts such as loops and conditional statements.

**Difficulty:** Easy

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Basic String Manipulation**: Understanding how strings can be indexed and manipulated.
2. **Loops**: Typically involves a `for` loop iterating from the end of the string back to the beginning, checking each character until a non-zero digit is encountered.
3. **Conditional Statements**: To handle cases where no trailing zeros are present.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) since we're potentially visiting every character in worst-case scenarios (all characters being zeros).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of input size. This is because only one new string needs to be created for the result.

**Solution Strategy:**
The solution involves iterating through each character of the string from right to left using a `for` loop, starting at the last index (`num.size() - 1`). The goal is to skip all trailing zeros and construct a new string that contains only non-zero digits. Once we encounter a non-zero digit, we break out of the loop because any characters following it will also be part of the result (as they're not trailing zeros). We then concatenate these non-zero digits into a new string which will be returned as the final output.

This problem falls under **String Processing**, and is categorized as an easy difficulty due to its straightforward nature, requiring minimal logic beyond basic programming constructs. It's suitable for beginners or those looking to practice simple string manipulation tasks in their preferred programming language.
