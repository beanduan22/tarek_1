Problem ID: 3373
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums.
Return an integer that is the maximum distance between the indices of two (not necessarily different) prime numbers in nums.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,9,5,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: nums[1], nums[3], and nums[4] are prime. So the answer is |4 - 1| = 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,8,2,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: nums[2] is prime. Because there is just one prime number, the answer is |2 - 2| = 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
The input is generated such that the number of prime numbers in the nums is at least one.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem falls into the 'Medium' difficulty level. It requires understanding of both array traversal and basic algorithms for finding prime numbers.

The programming skills needed include:
- Array/sequence manipulation: To iterate over each element in `nums` to check if it's a prime number or not, and then calculate distances between different primes.
- Conditional logic: For checking whether an element is prime based on the constraints provided (`1 <= nums[i] <= 100`).
- Basic algorithms: Finding prime numbers can be tricky depending on your approach (e.g., naive implementation might involve iterating from `2` to `n/2`, which isn't efficient for large `n`). Some optimization techniques like checking divisibility only up to the square root of `n`, or using a pre-generated list of primes could help.

The time complexity would depend on how efficiently you generate and check prime numbers. If done naively, it might be $O(n^2)$ (where each number is checked for primality). However, with optimizations like the Sieve of Eratosthenes to get a list of primes up front, or by checking divisibility only up to $\sqrt{n}$ per number, you can reduce this complexity.

The space complexity would be either $O(1)$ if finding primes on-the-fly, or $O(n)$ if pre-generating the list of primes within some reasonable limit based on constraints (which might require adjusting for large inputs). 

In summary, while basic knowledge and skills are sufficient to tackle this problem, efficiency in algorithms and optimization techniques would significantly affect performance.
