Problem ID: 3411
Problem Content:
A powerful array for an integer x is the shortest sorted array of powers of two that sum up to x. For example, the powerful array for 11 is [1, 2, 8].
The array big_nums is created by concatenating the powerful arrays for every positive integer i in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, and so forth. Thus, big_nums starts as [1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...].
You are given a 2D integer matrix queries, where for queries[i] = [from_i, to_i, mod_i] you should calculate (big_nums[from_i] * big_nums[from_i + 1] * ... * big_nums[to_i]) % mod_i.
Return an integer array answer such that answer[i] is the answer to the i^th query.
 
Example 1:

Input: queries = [[1,3,7]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
There is one query.
big_nums[1..3] = [2,1,2]. The product of them is 4. The remainder of 4 under 7 is 4.

Example 2:

Input: queries = [[2,5,3],[7,7,4]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
There are two queries.
First query: big_nums[2..5] = [1,2,4,1]. The product of them is 8. The remainder of 8 under 3 is 2.
Second query: big_nums[7] = 2. The remainder of 2 under 4 is 2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= queries.length <= 500
queries[i].length == 3
0 <= queries[i][0] <= queries[i][1] <= 10^15
1 <= queries[i][2] <= 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
This is a competitive programming problem that involves several areas of computer science:

**Language/Tools:** This problem doesn't specify any particular language or toolset. Since it's from a context not requiring specific dependencies (like an online judge), any general-purpose programming language with support for basic math operations, arrays and matrix handling would suffice.

**Required Skills:** The primary skills required are:
1. **Understanding of Array Manipulation:** This involves creating dynamic arrays and managing the concatenation process.
2. **Handling Large Numbers:** The constraints suggest dealing with potentially very large integers (up to 10^15), so efficient multiplication methods and modulo operations are crucial.
3. **Efficient Computation:** Due to constraints on `queries.length`, efficient computation of each product is necessary, possibly involving optimization for repeated computations.

**Problem Complexity:**
- **Input Size:** The maximum length of queries can reach up to 500 (not very large), suggesting the core challenge lies elsewhere rather than in processing a large number of inputs.
- **Time Complexity:** The straightforward approach might involve multiplying arrays element by element, which could be inefficient for large numbers. A more optimized solution would involve using modular exponentiation or other math optimizations depending on how products can be efficiently computed modulo `mod_i` without directly performing the multiplication.
- **Space Complexity:** Since queries are not dependent on each other and the main operation is to calculate a product for each query, space complexity mainly depends on storing the arrays and results. Efficient use of space could involve reusing data structures or optimizing memory allocation.

**Category Prediction:**
Given these points, this problem leans more towards **Competitive Programming/Algorithms**, rather than specific languages like Python or Java, as it doesn't have a direct language-specific requirement beyond basic data structure handling and math operations. Its focus on efficient computation suggests an interest in algorithm optimization techniques for dealing with large numbers.

**Additional Note:** The problem involves mathematical concepts related to powers of two and modular arithmetic, hinting at a deeper understanding of number theory being useful in devising the solution strategy. 

Thus, categorizing this problem requires attention to how it integrates fundamental algorithms (like array manipulation) along with advanced topics like efficient multiplication methods under modulo constraints.
