Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums. We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].
base[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n). For example, base[1] = [1, 1] and base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3].
Return true if the given array is good, otherwise return false.
Note: A permutation of integers represents an arrangement of these numbers.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 3]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. However, base[3] has four elements but array nums has three. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3]. So the answer is false.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1, 3, 3, 2]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 3, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 3. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[3] = [1, 2, 3, 3] (by swapping the second and fourth elements in nums, we reach base[3]). Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 1, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 1. It can be seen that nums is a permutation of base[1] = [1, 1]. Therefore, the answer is true.
Example 4:

Input: nums = [3, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: Since the maximum element of the array is 4, the only candidate n for which this array could be a permutation of base[n], is n = 4. However, base[4] has five elements but array nums has six. Therefore, it can not be a permutation of base[4] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. So the answer is false.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= num[i] <= 200

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem can be categorized under the following aspects:

Difficulty: Medium - The problem involves basic array manipulation and understanding of permutations, which is relatively straightforward but requires careful analysis to identify edge cases.

Required Programming Skills: Basic Algorithmic Thinking, Array Manipulation, and Checking Conditions - No advanced data structures or complex algorithms are required. Familiarity with loops, conditionals, and arrays in the programming language of choice will be sufficient.

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n) - We need to iterate through the array once to find the maximum value and verify if it forms a valid permutation according to the problem constraints.
Space Complexity: O(1) - The solution doesn't require any additional space apart from constant variables for tracking max value, frequency count etc.

The problem primarily tests one's ability to correctly identify patterns in sequences (permutations), compare those with predefined rules (maximum length of base array), and apply logical checks efficiently. This aligns well with common interview or competitive programming questions that focus on algorithmic thinking rather than complex implementation details.
