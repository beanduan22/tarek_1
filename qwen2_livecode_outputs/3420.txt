Problem ID: 3420
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums, an integer array queries, and an integer x.
For each queries[i], you need to find the index of the queries[i]^th occurrence of x in the nums array. If there are fewer than queries[i] occurrences of x, the answer should be -1 for that query.
Return an integer array answer containing the answers to all queries.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,7], queries = [1,3,2,4], x = 1
Output: [0,-1,2,-1]
Explanation:

For the 1^st query, the first occurrence of 1 is at index 0.
For the 2^nd query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.
For the 3^rd query, the second occurrence of 1 is at index 2.
For the 4^th query, there are only two occurrences of 1 in nums, so the answer is -1.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], queries = [10], x = 5
Output: [-1]
Explanation:

For the 1^st query, 5 doesn't exist in nums, so the answer is -1.


 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length, queries.length <= 10^5
1 <= queries[i] <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i], x <= 10^4

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem falls under the categories of "Arrays" and "Sorting & Searching", with a moderate level of difficulty. 

The problem involves iterating over an array to find occurrences of specific elements as indicated by queries. This requires understanding how arrays work in your programming language of choice and skills related to indexing, searching, and basic algorithmic approaches like iteration or searching algorithms.

**Required Programming Skills:**
- Basic proficiency with a programming language supporting arrays.
- Ability to iterate over an array efficiently.
- Understanding of index-based operations in arrays.

**Complexity Concerns:**

1. **Time Complexity:** The problem involves iterating through the queries for each occurrence of `x` in the nums array, which results in a time complexity that is at least O(n*m), where n is the length of `nums`, and m is the number of elements in `queries`. This could potentially lead to high computational cost if both arrays are large.

2. **Space Complexity:** The problem does not seem to require significant additional memory beyond what's needed for input storage, so space complexity would likely be O(1) or proportional to the size of the output (O(n*m), depending on how many queries have valid results).

3. **Data Access Patterns:** Accessing elements in arrays sequentially is a common pattern here.

To optimize this problem, one could consider sorting techniques like using a `HashMap` for counting occurrences of each element and then querying these counts based on `queries`. However, due to the constraints on array sizes, brute-force approaches might be more practical unless there's an efficient data structure or algorithm that drastically reduces complexity for specific patterns in input arrays.

In summary, this problem requires understanding and implementing basic programming constructs related to arrays and searching while also thinking about optimization strategies given time constraint considerations.
