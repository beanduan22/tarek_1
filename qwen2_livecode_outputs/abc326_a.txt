Problem ID: abc326_a
Problem Content:
Takahashi is in a building with 100 floors.
He uses the stairs for moving up two floors or less or moving down three floors or less, and uses the elevator otherwise.
Does he use the stairs to move from floor X to floor Y?

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
X Y

Output

If Takahashi uses the stairs for the move, print Yes; if he uses the elevator, print No.

Constraints


- 1 \leq X,Y \leq 100
- X \neq Y
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

1 4

Sample Output 1

No

The move from floor 1 to floor 4 involves going up three floors, so Takahashi uses the elevator.

Sample Input 2

99 96

Sample Output 2

Yes

The move from floor 99 to floor 96 involves going down three floors, so Takahashi uses the stairs.

Sample Input 3

100 1

Sample Output 3

No

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the analysis of the given problem:

- **Difficulty Level**: The problem is relatively straightforward, focusing mainly on basic arithmetic operations such as comparisons and conditional evaluations. No advanced algorithms or data structures are needed.

- **Required Programming Skills**: The solution requires knowledge of how to read input from standard input (`Standard Input`), handle simple variable assignments, perform comparisons between integers, use logical operators (`if...else`) for decision-making, and print output using the `print()` function.

- **Complexity**: The time complexity is O(1) since there are no loops or recursive calls that scale with input size. Similarly, space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.

Given these aspects:

**Category Prediction**: This problem falls under the category of **Easy Programming Problem**. It tests basic programming skills and the ability to follow instructions closely while dealing with simple mathematical conditions. The solution would involve writing a conditional statement that checks whether moving between floors involves less than 2 upwards steps or less than 3 downwards steps (using stairs), otherwise, it uses an elevator.

The implementation might look something like this in Python:

```python
# Read input values X and Y from standard input
X, Y = map(int, input().split())

# Calculate the difference between Y and X
difference = abs(Y - X)

# Determine if Takahashi should use stairs or elevator based on floor difference
if (difference <= 2) or (difference >= 3):
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
```

This code snippet covers all constraints (`1 ≤ X, Y ≤ 100`, `X ≠ Y`) and handles the logic of determining whether Takahashi uses stairs based on floor differences as described in the problem statement.
