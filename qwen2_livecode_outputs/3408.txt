Problem ID: 3408
Problem Content:
You are given a string word. A letter is called special if it appears both in lowercase and uppercase in word.
Return the number of special letters in word.
 
Example 1:

Input: word = "aaAbcBC"
Output: 3
Explanation:
The special characters in word are 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

Example 2:

Input: word = "abc"
Output: 0
Explanation:
No character in word appears in uppercase.

Example 3:

Input: word = "abBCab"
Output: 1
Explanation:
The only special character in word is 'b'.

 
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 50
word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided:

- **Difficulty**: The problem appears to be relatively simple as it requires understanding a basic concept in string manipulation within programming. It doesn't involve complex algorithms or data structures.

- **Required Programming Skills**:
  - Basic understanding of strings: This involves knowledge of how to access and manipulate individual characters of a string.
  - Conditional logic: To determine if an uppercase version of the lowercase character exists, which requires comparing lowercase and uppercase versions of characters.
  
- **Complexity**: The solution might require linear time complexity (O(n)), where n is the length of the word. This is because we need to iterate through each character in the string once.

Given these factors, I would categorize this problem as **Easy** on platforms that classify coding problems based on difficulty levels like LeetCode or HackerRank. It aims to test basic programming skills and understanding of string operations rather than advanced algorithms or complex logic flows.
