Problem ID: 3395
Problem Content:
You are given a string s, which is known to be a concatenation of anagrams of some string t.
Return the minimum possible length of the string t.
An anagram is formed by rearranging the letters of a string. For example, "aab", "aba", and, "baa" are anagrams of "aab".
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abba"
Output: 2
Explanation:
One possible string t could be "ba".

Example 2:

Input: s = "cdef"
Output: 4
Explanation:
One possible string t could be "cdef", notice that t can be equal to s.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consist only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem falls under the category of "String Manipulation" with a moderate level of difficulty. It requires knowledge in several key areas:

1. **Understanding Anagrams:** The core concept is recognizing that anagrams can be rearrangements of each other. This implies they should have identical character frequency.

2. **Frequency Counting:** You need to calculate the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. This involves iterating over the string and counting occurrences of every character.

3. **Optimal Solution:** The main challenge is finding the minimum length of the original string from which these anagrams are derived. A key insight is that the optimal answer will be composed of unique characters, minimizing redundancy in frequency counts across different permutations.

4. **Algorithm Complexity:** Efficiently computing and using these frequencies requires a well-optimized approach. Counting each character only once (by traversing the input string) is crucial for achieving linear time complexity (`O(n)`), where `n` is the length of the string.

5. **Data Structures Usage:** In some cases, you might consider utilizing data structures such as hash maps or arrays to store and manipulate these frequencies efficiently.

6. **Problem-Solving Skill Level:** This problem demands a strategic approach towards minimizing redundancy, which can be challenging without proper planning on how to effectively compare frequencies across different anagrams.

In summary, this programming problem tests fundamental string manipulation skills alongside algorithmic optimization practices. It requires not just the ability to process and count character frequencies but also insight into how these frequencies relate back to forming minimal-length original strings from which various anagrams are derived.
