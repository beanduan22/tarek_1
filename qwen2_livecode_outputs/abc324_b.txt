Problem ID: abc324_b
Problem Content:
You are given a positive integer N.
If there are integers x and y such that N=2^x3^y, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print a single line containing Yes if there are integers x and y that satisfy the condition, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 1\leq N\leq10^{18}
- N is an integer.

Sample Input 1

324

Sample Output 1

Yes

For x=2,y=4, we have 2^x3^y=2^23^4=4\times81=324, so the condition is satisfied.
Thus, you should print Yes.

Sample Input 2

5

Sample Output 2

No

There are no integers x and y such that 2^x3^y=5.
Thus, you should print No.

Sample Input 3

32

Sample Output 3

Yes

For x=5,y=0, we have 2^x3^y=32\times1=32, so you should print Yes.

Sample Input 4

37748736

Sample Output 4

Yes

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the provided details about the problem:

1. **Problem Difficulty**: The task involves understanding number theory principles (specifically dealing with powers of numbers) and basic arithmetic operations like exponentiation and comparison. This is considered a medium-level difficulty in competitive coding or as part of an intermediate programming course, since it requires logical reasoning but does not involve complex algorithms or data structures.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: To solve this problem, you need to be familiar with:
   - Basic input/output operations using standard input/output (stdin/stdout).
   - Understanding and implementing exponentiation functions.
   - Condition checking and logical decision-making based on the result of mathematical computations.

3. **Complexity**: The complexity here is linear as we are performing a single operation in terms of time complexity (`O(1)`), since it doesn't depend on the size of input (N). However, considering space complexity, it's also constant (`O(1)`) because no additional data structures that grow with input size are used.

Given these points, this problem can be classified as:

**Category**: Intermediate/Advanced Beginner Level, Category: Algorithms - Number Theory

The skills required align well with what someone learning programming or preparing for coding interviews would need to understand and apply concepts of number theory in a practical context. The time constraints aren't mentioned here but are usually not a factor unless explicitly stated in the contest guidelines.

For a full solution, one might typically use programming languages like Python which handle large integers efficiently without requiring external libraries (since Python's `int` type supports arbitrarily large numbers). C++ could also be used effectively given its support for large number calculations with the right techniques or libraries.
