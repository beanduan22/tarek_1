Problem ID: 2800
Problem Content:
You are given a string s consisting only of uppercase English letters.
You can apply some operations to this string where, in one operation, you can remove any occurrence of one of the substrings "AB" or "CD" from s.
Return the minimum possible length of the resulting string that you can obtain.
Note that the string concatenates after removing the substring and could produce new "AB" or "CD" substrings.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "ABFCACDB"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Remove the substring "ABFCACDB", so s = "FCACDB".
- Remove the substring "FCACDB", so s = "FCAB".
- Remove the substring "FCAB", so s = "FC".
So the resulting length of the string is 2.
It can be shown that it is the minimum length that we can obtain.
Example 2:

Input: s = "ACBBD"
Output: 5
Explanation: We cannot do any operations on the string so the length remains the same.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of uppercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the given description and requirements, this problem falls under the category of "String Processing" or "Pattern Matching". The level of difficulty would be considered medium to high as it involves understanding string manipulation, tracking patterns within the strings (in this case, 'AB' and 'CD'), making recursive decisions based on those patterns, and optimizing operations until a minimal result is achieved.

Required programming skills include:
1. **String handling**: Understanding how to iterate over and manipulate strings in your chosen language.
2. **Pattern recognition**: Being able to identify specific substrings within the string (like "AB" or "CD").
3. **Algorithmic thinking**: The need to make recursive decisions based on removal of patterns, indicating an algorithmic approach might be required to optimize the operations.

Complexity:
- **Time complexity** could potentially depend on the length of the input string and the number of times certain pattern removals happen. It's not straightforward due to recursion involved in matching multiple occurrences in one operation.
- **Space complexity** would likely be relatively low as most modern implementations can handle strings with reasonable memory efficiency.

To solve this problem, you might use an algorithm that simulates removing "AB" or "CD" substrings from the string until no more removals are possible. A simple approach could involve using a stack to keep track of characters and checking for 'A' followed by 'B' or 'C' followed by 'D'. If such patterns are found, they are removed; otherwise, the last character is pushed onto the stack.

This problem can be effectively solved using techniques like recursion or dynamic programming based on how you choose to handle overlapping removals and optimization of operations. The exact implementation would depend heavily on the chosen programming language's capabilities for string manipulation and recursion management.
