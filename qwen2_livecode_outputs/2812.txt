Problem ID: 2812
Problem Content:
You are given two integers, num and t.
An integer x is called achievable if it can become equal to num after applying the following operation no more than t times:

Increase or decrease x by 1, and simultaneously increase or decrease num by 1.

Return the maximum possible achievable number. It can be proven that there exists at least one achievable number.
 
Example 1:

Input: num = 4, t = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 6; it can become equal to num after performing this operation:
1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5. 
It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 6.


Example 2:

Input: num = 3, t = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum achievable number is x = 7; after performing these operations, x will equal num: 
1- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 6 and num = 4.
2- Decrease x by 1, and increase num by 1. Now, x = 5 and num = 5.
It can be proven that there is no achievable number larger than 7.

 
Constraints:

1 <= num, t <= 50

Qwen2 Analysis:
Category: Medium Difficulty | Problem Solving Skills Required: Basic Math, Brute Force or Greedy Strategy | Complexity: O(t)

Explanation:

The problem involves finding the maximum achievable number given two integers `num` and `t`, under specific conditions. The solution revolves around understanding how operations can be applied to reach a target value, which requires simple arithmetic calculations.

**Difficulty**: This is considered a medium difficulty problem due to its straightforward nature in terms of algorithmic complexity but might require careful analysis for those not familiar with the concept. 

**Problem Solving Skills Required**: To solve this problem, one needs basic understanding of arithmetic operations and possibly an intuitive grasp on how increasing or decreasing `x` affects the difference between `num` and `x`. The solution involves applying a greedy strategy where in each step you aim to maximize the value by either increasing/decreasing both num and x.

**Complexity**: The time complexity is relatively simple, depending mainly on variable `t`, making it O(t). This is because the brute force approach would involve checking all possible numbers up to `num + t` (as an upper bound) which can be linear in terms of `t`. 

In summary, this problem tests basic programming skills and understanding of arithmetic operations rather than complex algorithmic concepts. It requires careful consideration but doesn't involve recursion, dynamic programming or other complex techniques.
