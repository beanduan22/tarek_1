Problem ID: 3394
Problem Content:
You are given two integers n and x. You have to construct an array of positive integers nums of size n where for every 0 <= i < n - 1, nums[i + 1] is greater than nums[i], and the result of the bitwise AND operation between all elements of nums is x.
Return the minimum possible value of nums[n - 1].
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, x = 4
Output: 6
Explanation:
nums can be [4,5,6] and its last element is 6.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2, x = 7
Output: 15
Explanation:
nums can be [7,15] and its last element is 15.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, x <= 10^8

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem seems to require a good understanding of bitwise operations and binary representations. The challenge involves generating an array under certain constraints (ascending order and bitwise AND equals to x) while trying to minimize the last element of the array.

From this perspective:

1. **Required Programming Skills**: It requires knowledge about array manipulation, understanding of bitwise operators in programming languages like AND operation (`&`), and logical reasoning to handle constraints efficiently.

2. **Difficulty Level**: The problem involves an algorithmic challenge that requires careful consideration of how binary numbers represent values, their ordering when incremented, and bitwise operations. This implies it's likely a medium difficulty problem.

3. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Time Complexity: Constructing the array will require iteration up to `n` times which gives us a time complexity of O(n).
   - Space Complexity: The additional space required seems minimal as we're only storing an integer (`x`) and potentially an array for output if needed, thus making it constant or O(1).

Thus, categorizing this problem:

- **Category**: Medium difficulty Algorithm Problem with a focus on bitwise operations and array manipulation.

This type of question is common in competitive programming interviews where candidates are expected to demonstrate their understanding of low-level binary representations as well as algorithmic thinking.
