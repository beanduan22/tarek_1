Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 2 and 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters and |.
- S contains exactly two |s.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above can be categorized as a straightforward string manipulation task in competitive programming or coding interviews. The difficulty level is considered to be "Easy", given that it requires only basic knowledge of strings and loops (or conditional statements) and does not involve complex algorithms or data structures.

### Required Programming Skills:

1. **String Manipulation**: Understanding how to access, modify, and extract parts of a string.
2. **Conditional Logic**: Knowing when and where to apply certain conditions based on the input structure.
3. **Sequence Iteration**: Being able to loop through elements of a sequence (in this case, characters in a string) is beneficial.

### Complexity:

The time complexity for solving this problem would be O(n), where n is the length of the input string S. This is because we need to iterate through each character at least once to determine which part of the string should be removed and which should not.

The space complexity could range from O(1) if a fixed amount of space is used for storing variables (e.g., only two pointers or counters), up to O(n) depending on how we choose to handle the output. A typical approach would use constant additional space, assuming that the output string can be constructed in-place.

### Solution Approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing two pointers (`start` and `end`) which will mark the boundaries of the region between the two `|`.
2. **Traversal**: Iterate through the string from left to right.
   - Update `start` when you find the first `|`.
   - Update `end` when you encounter the second `|`.
3. **Construction**: Construct the output string excluding the region marked by `start` and `end`.
4. **Output**: Print or return the constructed output.

### Example Code Snippet (in Python):

```python
def remove_between_pipes(s):
    start = end = -1  # Initialize pointers
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '|':
            if start == -1:
                start = i
            else:
                end = i
        if start != -1 and end != -1:
            break
    return s[:start] + s[end+1:]

# Example usage
print(remove_between_pipes("atcoder|beginner|contest"))
```

This example assumes Python as the programming language, which has built-in string manipulation capabilities that simplify many tasks. The logic is straightforward and follows closely to the description in the question.
