Problem ID: abc320_a
Problem Content:
You are given positive integers A and B.
Print the value A^B+B^A.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

Print the answer as an integer.

Constraints


- 2 \leq A \leq B \leq 9
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

2 8

Sample Output 1

320

For A = 2, B = 8, we have A^B = 256, B^A = 64, so A^B + B^A = 320.

Sample Input 2

9 9

Sample Output 2

774840978

Sample Input 3

5 6

Sample Output 3

23401

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above is a simple arithmetic calculation problem with basic input-output format. It doesn't require any complex data structures or algorithms beyond standard mathematical operations and basic programming constructs like variables, assignment statements, and arithmetic calculations.

Here are the main points that categorize this problem:

1. **Difficulty**: This falls under low difficulty level as it involves straightforward computation.
2. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - Reading input from standard input (which is a common skill in most programming contests and exercises).
   - Basic arithmetic operations like exponentiation, which may require specific functions depending on the programming language used.
   - Data type management to ensure that large values can be accurately calculated and printed without issues like overflow or loss of precision.
3. **Complexity**: The problem has linear complexity since it involves performing a constant number (2) of arithmetic operations with potentially larger numbers based on input.

Given these characteristics, the problem falls under the category of "Easy/Beginner" level problems in programming contests and exercises. It tests basic understanding of arithmetic operations, data type handling, and control flow constructs like assignment statements.
