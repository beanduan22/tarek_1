Problem ID: 3200
Problem Content:
You are given an integer n.
A string s is called good if it contains only lowercase English characters and it is possible to rearrange the characters of s such that the new string contains "leet" as a substring.
For example:

The string "lteer" is good because we can rearrange it to form "leetr" .
"letl" is not good because we cannot rearrange it to contain "leet" as a substring.

Return the total number of good strings of length n.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
 
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 4
Output: 12
Explanation: The 12 strings which can be rearranged to have "leet" as a substring are: "eelt", "eetl", "elet", "elte", "etel", "etle", "leet", "lete", "ltee", "teel", "tele", and "tlee".

Example 2:

Input: n = 10
Output: 83943898
Explanation: The number of strings with length 10 which can be rearranged to have "leet" as a substring is 526083947580. Hence the answer is 526083947580 % (10^9 + 7) = 83943898.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem involves counting the number of good strings (strings that contain "leet" as a substring) of length `n` under certain constraints.

**Analysis:**

1. **Problem Complexity**: The problem is quite complex because it requires not only generating all possible combinations but also checking each combination to see if it contains the required substring ("leet"). It involves combinatorics, string manipulation, and possibly some advanced data structures or algorithms for efficient computation.

2. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - **Algorithmic Thinking**: The problem requires devising an algorithm that efficiently generates all possible combinations of strings with length `n` and checks them against the condition of containing "leet" as a substring.
   - **Mathematical Reasoning**: Efficient counting of valid combinations involves understanding combinatorial principles, which might require familiarity with modular arithmetic for handling large numbers efficiently (i.e., calculating results modulo 10^9 + 7).
   - **String Manipulation**: The problem involves string operations like rearranging characters and checking substrings.

3. **Approach Complexity**:
   - A naive approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` and then checking each one for the presence of "leet". This would be highly inefficient (O(26^n)), making it impractical for even moderate values of `n`.
   - A more efficient solution might leverage dynamic programming or combinatorial mathematics to avoid generating all combinations directly.

**Category Prediction:**

Given the complexity mentioned above, this problem likely falls under **Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures**, specifically focusing on combinatorics and string processing. It combines elements from both fields and requires a deep understanding of algorithms for efficiency (such as dynamic programming or mathematical counting techniques).

This type of question is typically found in competitive coding interviews where candidates are expected to demonstrate skills not only in code implementation but also in identifying efficient solution strategies, handling large data efficiently with constraints like modulo operations, and applying combinatorial math concepts. It showcases the ability to reason about the underlying principles that govern certain computations rather than just implementing known algorithms.

Therefore, it's best classified as an **Advanced Difficulty** problem that tests complex algorithmic skills alongside mathematical reasoning capabilities in a programming context.
