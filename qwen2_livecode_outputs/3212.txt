Problem ID: 3212
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers.
A partition of an array into one or more contiguous subarrays is called good if no two subarrays contain the same number.
Return the total number of good partitions of nums.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 possible good partitions are: ([1], [2], [3], [4]), ([1], [2], [3,4]), ([1], [2,3], [4]), ([1], [2,3,4]), ([1,2], [3], [4]), ([1,2], [3,4]), ([1,2,3], [4]), and ([1,2,3,4]).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible good partition is: ([1,1,1,1]).

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 possible good partitions are: ([1,2,1], [3]) and ([1,2,1,3]).

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem appears to be of medium difficulty level. It requires a good understanding of array manipulation and dynamic programming concepts.

**Required Programming Skills:**
- Basic knowledge of arrays and their operations.
- Proficiency in using loops (for-loops or while-loops).
- Ability to implement dynamic programming techniques for counting tasks.

**Category Prediction:**
This problem could be categorized under:
1. **Dynamic Programming**: Since it involves partitioning an array into subarrays with specific conditions, which often requires keeping track of different states and updating them based on previous solutions.
2. **Array Manipulation**: The task revolves around creating partitions based on the given array elements, implying modifications and operations related to arrays.

**Complexity:**
The problem complexity is balanced between straightforward implementation tasks (like iterating through the array) and more complex logic (like determining good partitions). This balance makes it a medium-level problem suitable for candidates who have basic programming skills but need to develop proficiency in specific areas like dynamic programming or array manipulation.

In summary, this programming problem combines aspects of array operations with dynamic programming techniques, making it suitable for candidates aiming to improve their skills in these areas. The solution would involve developing an algorithm that efficiently counts the number of valid partitions under the given constraints, potentially utilizing a dynamic programming approach to reduce complexity and ensure efficiency.
