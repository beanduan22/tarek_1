Problem ID: abc324_a
Problem Content:
You are given N integers A _ 1,A _ 2,\ldots,A _ N.
If their values are all equal, print Yes; otherwise, print No.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
A _ 1 A _ 2 \ldots A _ N

Output

Print a single line containing Yes if the values of the given A _ 1,A _ 2,\ldots,A _ N are all equal, and No otherwise.

Constraints


- 2\leq N\leq100
- 1\leq A _ i\leq100\ (1\leq i\leq N)
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

3
3 2 4

Sample Output 1

No

We have A _ 1\neq A _ 2, so you should print No.

Sample Input 2

4
3 3 3 3

Sample Output 2

Yes

We have A _ 1=A _ 2=A _ 3=A _ 4, so you should print Yes.

Sample Input 3

10
73 8 55 26 97 48 37 47 35 55

Sample Output 3

No

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described here involves basic operations with arrays (or lists), such as comparing array elements to each other. The solution requires only simple conditional checks, no loops or complex algorithms are needed.

**Category Prediction:**

1. **Difficulty Level:** This task is relatively straightforward because it mainly tests the understanding of loop structures and comparison operators in a programming language. Given that most modern programming languages have these features by default, beginners might find this problem easy to understand and implement.

2. **Required Programming Skills:** Basic programming skills are sufficient here:
   - Ability to read input from standard input (for example, `input()` in Python).
   - Knowledge of how to store data in arrays or lists.
   - Experience with basic loops (such as for-loops) to iterate over the array elements.
   - Proficiency with conditional statements (`if`, `else`) to compare values and make decisions based on conditions.

3. **Complexity:** The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the input list or array. This is because you need to look at each element once to determine if they are all equal. Similarly, space complexity would be O(1) as no additional data structures proportional to the input size are used.

**Educational Value:**

This problem helps reinforce basic concepts like:
- **Data types and values:** Understanding how numbers can be stored and compared.
- **Control flow:** Using loops (`for` loop here) to iterate through all elements of an array or list, and decision-making with `if` statements.
- **Input processing:** Getting used to inputting data from standard input in programming.

Overall, this problem would likely fit into a beginner-friendly coding challenge that aims to assess basic programming skills in any language.
