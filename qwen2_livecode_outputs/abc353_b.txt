Problem Content:
The AtCoder amusement park has an attraction that can accommodate K people. Now, there are N groups lined up in the queue for this attraction.
The i-th group from the front (1\leq i\leq N) consists of A_i people. For all i (1\leq i\leq N), it holds that A_i \leq K.
Takahashi, as a staff member of this attraction, will guide the groups in the queue according to the following procedure.
Initially, no one has been guided to the attraction, and there are K empty seats.

- If there are no groups in the queue, start the attraction and end the guidance.
- Compare the number of empty seats in the attraction with the number of people in the group at the front of the queue, and do one of the following:
- If the number of empty seats is less than the number of people in the group at the front, start the attraction. Then, the number of empty seats becomes K again.
- Otherwise, guide the entire group at the front of the queue to the attraction. The front group is removed from the queue, and the number of empty seats decreases by the number of people in the group.


- Go back to step 1.

Here, no additional groups will line up after the guidance has started. Under these conditions, it can be shown that this procedure will end in a finite number of steps.
Determine how many times the attraction will be started throughout the guidance.

Initially, the seven groups are lined up as follows:

Part of Takahashi's guidance is shown in the following figure:


- Initially, the group at the front has 2 people, and there are 6 empty seats. Thus, he guides the front group to the attraction, leaving 4 empty seats.
- Next, the group at the front has 5 people, which is more than the 4 empty seats, so the attraction is started.
- After the attraction is started, there are 6 empty seats again, so the front group is guided to the attraction, leaving 1 empty seat.
- Next, the group at the front has 1 person, so they are guided to the attraction, leaving 0 empty seats.

In total, he starts the attraction four times before the guidance is completed.
Therefore, print 4.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above falls into the category of **Algorithm** with a particular focus on **Simulation/Iteration**. This is because it requires understanding the sequence of events (people entering attractions, empty seats filling up) and iterating through these steps until a certain condition is met (all groups have been guided).

Key Skills Required:

1. **Loop Control**: The core of this problem involves loops to simulate each step of the procedure described.
2. **Condition Checking**: It's important to check conditions at each step, such as whether there are groups in line or if empty seats match group sizes.
3. **Data Handling**: Efficiently managing data related to group sizes and attraction capacities.

In terms of difficulty:

- **Easy to Understand**: The problem statement is clear and doesn't require deep theoretical knowledge upfront.
- **Step-by-step Approach**: Solving it typically involves a straightforward, step-by-step procedure which simplifies the complexity.

The main challenge lies in accurately implementing these steps without making mistakes that could lead to logic errors or inefficiencies. Careful consideration must be given to edge cases and ensuring termination conditions are correctly handled.
