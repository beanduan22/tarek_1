Problem Content:
You are given a sequence A=(A_1,\ldots,A_N) of length N. The elements of A are distinct.
Process Q queries in the order they are given. Each query is of one of the following two types:

- 1 x y : Insert y immediately after the element x in A. It is guaranteed that x exists in A when this query is given.
- 2 x : Remove the element x from A. It is guaranteed that x exists in A when this query is given.

It is guaranteed that after processing each query, A will not be empty, and its elements will be distinct.
Print A after processing all the queries.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:

The queries are processed as follows:

- Initially, A=(2,1,4,3).
- The first query removes 1, making A=(2,4,3).
- The second query inserts 5 immediately after 4, making A=(2,4,5,3).
- The third query removes 2, making A=(4,5,3).
- The fourth query inserts 1 immediately after 5, making A=(4,5,1,3).

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above seems to involve manipulating a list or sequence through two types of operations:

1. **Insertion**: Add an element after a specific position in the list. This implies that the list is dynamic and elements can be inserted at any point based on their relative positions.

2. **Deletion**: Remove an element from the list. The constraint specifies that when deleting, we assume the element exists in the list. 

Given these operations and constraints:

- Handling of large data sizes (N ≤ 2*10^5 elements and Q ≤ 2*10^5 queries).
- Use of integers for both array elements and query values.
- Queries requiring efficient execution to maintain performance on large inputs.

**Category Prediction**:

This type of problem aligns well with the following categories based on difficulty, programming skills required, and complexity considerations:

1. **Data Structures**: The use of lists or arrays that can be manipulated dynamically suggests this is heavily data structure-oriented. One might consider using a list and implementing custom insertion and deletion routines to handle queries efficiently.

2. **Sorting Algorithms** & **Search Algorithms**: Although the primary operations are insertions and deletions, understanding how to efficiently search for elements in an array (or linked list) could influence the algorithm's efficiency since we need to check if an element exists before deleting it.

3. **Simulation/Looping Constructs**: Implementing these queries requires careful handling of loops and conditions that iterate through or manipulate sequences.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Given constraints on N and Q, optimizing the time complexity for both read operations (searching) and write operations (insertions/deletions) is crucial to ensure efficient processing of large inputs.

**Skills Required**:

- Understanding and application of data structures like dynamic lists.
- Efficient looping constructs capable of handling large iterations.
- Implementation skills that balance readability with performance, especially in the context of potentially high input sizes.
- Algorithmic complexity analysis to optimize operations for large-scale applications.

**Complexity Considerations**:

- **Time Complexity**: Efficient algorithms should aim for a lower bound than O(n^2) per operation due to constraints on N and Q. A better algorithm might achieve something closer to O(log n) or potentially amortized O(1), depending on the structure used.
- **Space Complexity**: While not explicitly mentioned, space complexity is generally secondary but should be considered for practical implementation (e.g., using a list versus an array).

In conclusion, this problem falls into categories that emphasize efficient data manipulation through insertion and deletion operations on dynamic lists. It requires skills in data structure handling, algorithm optimization, and potentially the use of specific programming constructs to achieve both correctness and performance under given constraints.
