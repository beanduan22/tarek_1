Problem ID: 3194
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a character x.
Return an array of indices representing the words that contain the character x.
Note that the returned array may be in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = ["leet","code"], x = "e"
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: "e" occurs in both words: "leet", and "code". Hence, we return indices 0 and 1.

Example 2:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "a"
Output: [0,2]
Explanation: "a" occurs in "abc", and "aaaa". Hence, we return indices 0 and 2.

Example 3:

Input: words = ["abc","bcd","aaaa","cbc"], x = "z"
Output: []
Explanation: "z" does not occur in any of the words. Hence, we return an empty array.

 
Constraints:

1 <= words.length <= 50
1 <= words[i].length <= 50
x is a lowercase English letter.
words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem provided seems to fall under the category of "Basic Data Structures & Algorithms". It involves iterating through an array (which could be considered as a list or vector in most programming languages), checking each element against a certain condition, and collecting those that satisfy this condition.

**Difficulty Level:** Easy to Medium

**Required Programming Skills:**
1. **Array/Vector Manipulation:** The task requires traversing an array of strings, which involves basic array traversal skills.
2. **String Search:** Knowing how to check if a specific character exists within a string is essential here. This can be done using in-built functions like `find()`, `indexOf()`, or iterating through each character in the string.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity would be O(N*M), where N represents the number of words (strings) and M, their average length. This is because for every word, we're checking every character against our target character `x`.
- **Space Complexity:** Assuming a straightforward implementation where we just store indices in an array or list, space complexity could potentially be O(N) if there are many matches or more optimistically O(1) with some language-specific optimizations like using the same input array to store results.

**Solution Approach:**
The main approach involves iterating through each word (string) in the given array `words` and for each word, checking every character against our target character `x`. If `x` is found, we append the index of that string into a result list or vector. Finally, return this list.

**Language Implementation Considerations:**
The implementation details can vary based on programming languages (e.g., using Python, Java, C++, etc.), but generally, the logic and complexity remain similar across these languages due to their similarities in basic operations like array traversal and string handling.

Overall, while it might seem straightforward, understanding data structures and the ability to implement simple search algorithms efficiently is key. This problem can serve as a good exercise for beginners looking to practice with basic string manipulations and arrays or vectors.
