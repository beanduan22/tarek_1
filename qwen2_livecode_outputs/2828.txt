Problem ID: 2828
Problem Content:
You are given a string s consisting of only lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can do the following:

Select any non-empty substring of s, possibly the entire string, then replace each one of its characters with the previous character of the English alphabet. For example, 'b' is converted to 'a', and 'a' is converted to 'z'.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after performing the above operation exactly once.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
A string x is lexicographically smaller than a string y of the same length if x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order for the first position i such that x[i] != y[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "cbabc"
Output: "baabc"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the substring starting at index 0, and ending at index 1 inclusive. 
It can be proven that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest. 

Example 2:

Input: s = "acbbc"
Output: "abaab"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the substring starting at index 1, and ending at index 4 inclusive. 
It can be proven that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest. 

Example 3:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "kddsbncd"
Explanation: We apply the operation on the entire string. 
It can be proven that the resulting string is the lexicographically smallest. 

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^5
s consists of lowercase English letters

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem can be categorized as a **String Manipulation** question with a moderate level of difficulty. This categorization is based on several factors:

1. **Difficulty Level**: The problem involves iterating through characters in a string to perform a specific transformation (replacing each character with its previous counterpart). This requires understanding basic programming concepts and the ability to manipulate strings, which are typically covered early in coding courses.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: To solve this problem, one needs to be familiar with:
   - Reading and manipulating strings.
   - Looping through elements of a string (using iterators or index-based access).
   - Conditional logic for making decisions based on character comparisons (in this case, determining whether each character should undergo the transformation).

3. **Complexity**: The main complexity arises from understanding how to traverse the string efficiently while applying transformations only where necessary (i.e., starting with 'a' and not performing unnecessary operations). This involves checking conditions under which the operation could lead to a lexicographically smaller result.

4. **Algorithmic Thinking**: The problem requires careful consideration of edge cases, such as when all characters are transformed or when the string starts with 'a', in which case no transformation is needed.

In summary, this question tests one's ability to work with strings and execute conditional logic on sequences of characters efficiently. It also highlights the importance of considering edge cases and performing operations judiciously based on specific criteria (in this case, character values).

The solution strategy might involve iterating through the string once while keeping track of the first occurrence of a 'z' or an uppercase letter to determine if transformations should be applied from that point onwards. This demonstrates the efficient use of computational resources by avoiding unnecessary operations on already processed data points and optimizing for readability and maintainability of code.
