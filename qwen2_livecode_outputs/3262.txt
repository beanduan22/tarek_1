Problem Content:
You are given an array of positive integers nums of length n.
A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.
Conversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive real numbers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k where a_1 <= a_2 <= a_3 <= ... <= a_k and a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_k-1 > a_k, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_k.
The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.
Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,5,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]
Output: 12
Explanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.
We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.
It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,5,50]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no possible way to form a polygon from nums, as a polygon has at least 3 sides and 50 > 5 + 5.

 
Constraints:

3 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem can be categorized as a **Medium Difficulty** question. It requires both understanding of basic data structures like arrays and some knowledge of mathematical concepts related to polygons.

### Analysis Steps:

#### Problem Understanding:
1. **Objective**: The primary goal is to find the largest perimeter possible for a polygon using elements from an array.
2. **Constraints**: 
   - Array size `n` ranges between 3 and $10^5$.
   - Each element in the array `$nums[i]` is constrained between 1 and $10^9$.

#### Solution Approach:
1. **Sorting**: The first step involves sorting the array `$nums`. This is crucial because to form a valid polygon, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side (excluding the longest side).

2. **Iterative Check**:
   - Iterate over the sorted list from the end towards the beginning.
   - For each iteration (`i`), check if `nums[i]` is smaller than the sum of all previous elements (`sum(nums[:i])`).
     - If yes, return `sum(nums)`, because you've found a valid polygon with at least three sides.

3. **Handling Outcomes**:
   - If no valid perimeter can be formed within the array, return `-1`.

#### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time**: Sorting an array takes $O(n\log{n})$ time complexity using efficient sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
  
- **Space**: Assuming a standard in-place sort technique is used (`Timsort`), which has `O(1)` auxiliary space complexity.

Given that the problem revolves around processing each element once and making decisions based on its values compared to others, it requires understanding of basic programming constructs along with sorting algorithms. This makes it suitable for an interview setting where one's grasp of data structure manipulation and algorithmic thinking is evaluated.

### Conclusion:
This question is best suited for interviews or assessments targeting candidates who have a foundational understanding of programming skills including array handling and algorithmic problem-solving. It tests the ability to apply concepts like sorting effectively within a computational context relevant to real-world problems.
