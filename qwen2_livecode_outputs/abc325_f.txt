Problem ID: abc325_f
Problem Content:
As the factory manager of Keyence, you want to monitor several sections on a conveyor belt. There are a total of N sections you want to monitor, and the length of the i-th section is D_i meters.
There are two types of sensors to choose from, and below is some information about each sensor.

- Type-j sensor (1\leq j \leq 2): Can monitor a section of length L_j meters.
The price is C_j per sensor, and you can use at most K_j sensors of this type in total.

You can divide one section into several sections for monitoring.
It is fine if the sections monitored by the sensors overlap, or if they monitor more than the length of the section you want to monitor.
For example, when L_1=4 and L_2=2, you can use one type-1 sensor to monitor a section of length 3 meters, or use one type-1 and one type-2 sensor to monitor a section of length 5 meters.
Determine whether it is possible to monitor all N sections, and if it is possible, find the minimum total cost of the necessary sensors.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N
D_1 D_2 \dots D_N
L_1 C_1 K_1
L_2 C_2 K_2

Output

If it is impossible to monitor all N sections, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum total cost of the necessary sensors.

Constraints


- 1\leq N \leq 100
- 1\leq D_i,L_j \leq 10^5
- 1\leq C_j \leq 10^9
- 1\leq K_j \leq 10^3
- All input values are integers.

You can monitor all sections by using three type-1 sensors and four type-2 sensors as follows.

- Use one type-1 sensor to monitor the first section.
- Use one type-1 and one type-2 sensor to monitor the second section.
- Use one type-1 and three type-2 sensors to monitor the third section.

In this case, the total cost of the necessary sensors is 3\times 3 + 2\times 4 = 17, which is the minimum.

It is fine if one type of sensor is not used at all.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem can be categorized as a _Hard_ level algorithm question that tests your understanding of **Dynamic Programming**, **Greedy Algorithms**, and **Optimization**. The key to solving this problem involves making efficient decisions about which sensors to use based on their capabilities (`L_j`) and costs (`C_j`), while staying within the limits (`K_j`) for each sensor type.

The problem deals with multiple constraints (such as `N`, `D_i`, `L_j`, etc.) and requires identifying the most cost-effective solution to cover all sections (`D_i`). This typically suggests a need for careful planning and potentially some form of optimization technique to minimize costs while ensuring coverage.

**Skills Required:**

1. **Understanding Sensor Capabilities**: You must understand how each sensor type works based on their `L_j` value (length they can monitor) and decide how efficiently these can be used across multiple sections (`D_i`).

2. **Handling Multiple Constraints**: The problem involves constraints like the total number of sensors (`N`) to monitor, costs per sensor (`C_j`), limits on usage (`K_j`), and varying lengths of sections (`D_i`). Efficiently dealing with these constraints is crucial.

3. **Dynamic Programming/Optimization Approach**: Typically, problems requiring the identification of minimum cost or maximum efficiency solutions involve dynamic programming techniques for optimization or greedy algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step to achieve a globally optimal solution.

4. **Algorithmic Logic and Problem Solving Skills**: You need to logically reason through different scenarios given by the input constraints to ensure all sections are covered, with minimal costs.

**Problem Complexity:**

The complexity involves both computational (in terms of processing large inputs efficiently) and logical complexity in devising an optimal strategy or approach. The problem might require multiple iterations, state transitions, or decision-making strategies which can impact its time complexity significantly.

Given the level of detail and constraints described, this type of question is well-suited for those aiming to improve their skills in algorithm design, particularly focusing on optimization techniques and dynamic programming paradigms. Solving such problems often involves breaking down complex requirements into simpler subproblems and reusing solutions from previous calculations (dynamic programming) or making immediate decisions that are best suited at each step without worrying about future consequences immediately (greedy algorithms).

In summary, the problem is structured to challenge your ability to:
- Understand and analyze multi-faceted constraints.
- Design an algorithm that optimally utilizes available resources given the costs and capabilities of sensor types.
- Execute a methodical approach for solving problems with multiple variables and conditions.
