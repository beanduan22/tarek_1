Problem ID: 3221
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array mountain. Your task is to find all the peaks in the mountain array.
Return an array that consists of indices of peaks in the given array in any order.
Notes:

A peak is defined as an element that is strictly greater than its neighboring elements.
The first and last elements of the array are not a peak.

 
Example 1:

Input: mountain = [2,4,4]
Output: []
Explanation: mountain[0] and mountain[2] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.
mountain[1] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[2].
So the answer is [].

Example 2:

Input: mountain = [1,4,3,8,5]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: mountain[0] and mountain[4] can not be a peak because they are first and last elements of the array.
mountain[2] also can not be a peak because it is not strictly greater than mountain[3] and mountain[1].
But mountain [1] and mountain[3] are strictly greater than their neighboring elements.
So the answer is [1,3].

 
Constraints:

3 <= mountain.length <= 100
1 <= mountain[i] <= 100

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem appears to be a simple array traversal task with conditions. Here's an analysis of its difficulty, required programming skills, and complexity:

**Difficulty Level:**
- **Easy:** The problem involves straightforward operations like iterating through the elements of the array. No advanced data structures or complex algorithms are needed.
  
**Required Programming Skills:**
- **Basic Array Manipulation:** Knowing how to access individual elements in an array and compare values is essential.
- **Conditional Logic:** Being able to write conditional statements (if/else) to check if a particular element meets the criteria of being a peak.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity for solving this problem would be O(n), where n is the length of the `mountain` array. This is because each element in the array needs to be visited once to determine if it's a peak or not, and no other operations need to be performed beyond basic comparisons.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity depends on how you store the results. In most cases, just storing the indices of peaks would require O(k) space where k is the number of peaks found. Since k will generally be less than n, we could consider this a constant factor in terms of efficiency relative to the input size.

**Category Prediction:**
Given these characteristics, I would categorize this problem as **Easy Array Processing** within the realm of basic programming skills and problems suitable for beginners or as part of an interview preparation guide.
