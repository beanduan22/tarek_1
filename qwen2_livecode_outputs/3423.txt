Problem ID: 3423
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums consisting of integers. You are also given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [pos_i, x_i].
For query i, we first set nums[pos_i] equal to x_i, then we calculate the answer to query i which is the maximum sum of a subsequence of nums where no two adjacent elements are selected.
Return the sum of the answers to all queries.
Since the final answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,9], queries = [[1,-2],[0,-3]]
Output: 21
Explanation:
After the 1^st query, nums = [3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 3 + 9 = 12.
After the 2^nd query, nums = [-3,-2,9] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 9.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,-1], queries = [[0,-5]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
After the 1^st query, nums = [-5,-1] and the maximum sum of a subsequence with non-adjacent elements is 0 (choosing an empty subsequence).

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 10^4
queries[i] == [pos_i, x_i]
0 <= pos_i <= nums.length - 1
-10^5 <= x_i <= 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem described above can be categorized as an "Algorithms" question with a specific focus on "Dynamic Programming" and "Array Manipulation". 

**Difficulty Level**: Medium to Hard. The solution requires understanding of dynamic programming techniques for optimal substructure problems.

**Required Programming Skills**: 
1. **Understanding of Array Manipulations**: To modify array elements based on queries.
2. **Dynamic Programming Concepts**: To solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts and solving each part individually (subproblems).
3. **Modular Arithmetic**: To handle large numbers by taking modulo with 10^9 + 7.

**Algorithm Complexity**:
1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution would be O(N * Q), where N is the size of the input array and Q is the number of queries. This might vary depending on the efficiency of solving each subproblem.
2. **Space Complexity**: The space required will depend on how you store intermediate states for dynamic programming (for instance, using arrays or maps to keep track of subproblems).

Given these aspects, this problem would require someone with a good grasp of algorithmic techniques and experience in implementing them efficiently, especially dealing with queries on an array while maintaining optimal computational complexity.
