Problem ID: abc319_c
Problem Content:
There is a 3\times3 grid with numbers between 1 and 9, inclusive, written in each square. The square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left (1\leq i\leq3,1\leq j\leq3) contains the number c _ {i,j}.
The same number may be written in different squares, but not in three consecutive cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
More precisely, it is guaranteed that c _ {i,j} satisfies all of the following conditions.

- c _ {i,1}=c _ {i,2}=c _ {i,3} does not hold for any 1\leq i\leq3. 
- c _ {1,j}=c _ {2,j}=c _ {3,j} does not hold for any 1\leq j\leq3.
- c _ {1,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {3,3} does not hold.
- c _ {3,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {1,3} does not hold.

Takahashi will see the numbers written in each cell in random order.
He will get disappointed when there is a line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) that satisfies the following condition.

- The first two squares he sees contain the same number, but the last square contains a different number.

Find the probability that Takahashi sees the numbers in all the squares without getting disappointed.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
c _ {1,1} c _ {1,2} c _ {1,3}
c _ {2,1} c _ {2,2} c _ {2,3}
c _ {3,1} c _ {3,2} c _ {3,3}

Output

Print one line containing the probability that Takahashi sees the numbers in all the squares without getting disappointed.
Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-8}.

Constraints


- c _ {i,j}\in\lbrace1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\rbrace\ (1\leq i\leq3,1\leq j\leq3)
- c _ {i,1}=c _ {i,2}=c _ {i,3} does not hold for any 1\leq i\leq3. 
- c _ {1,j}=c _ {2,j}=c _ {3,j} does not hold for any 1\leq j\leq3.
- c _ {1,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {3,3} does not hold.
- c _ {3,1}=c _ {2,2}=c _ {1,3} does not hold.

Sample Output 1

0.666666666666666666666666666667

For example, if Takahashi sees c _ {3,1}=2,c _ {2,1}=2,c _ {1,1}=3 in this order, he will get disappointed.

On the other hand, if Takahashi sees c _ {1,1},c _ {1,2},c _ {1,3},c _ {2,1},c _ {2,2},c _ {2,3},c _ {3,1},c _ {3,2},c _ {3,3} in this order, he will see all numbers without getting disappointed.
The probability that Takahashi sees all the numbers without getting disappointed is \dfrac 23.
Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute error from the true value is at most 10 ^ {-8}, so outputs such as 0.666666657 and 0.666666676 would also be accepted.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem can be categorized into several different aspects:

**Category**: **Probability & Combinatorics**

- The problem involves calculating probabilities which is a typical aspect of probability theory.
- It includes combinatorial calculations since it requires understanding the number of ways certain events can occur and comparing them with the total possible outcomes.
- There's also an element of logic and reasoning involved in determining valid sequences that won't lead to disappointment.

**Difficulty Level**: **Medium**

The problem isn't extremely complex, requiring a solid understanding of probability concepts and some combinatorial skills. It might involve recursive or dynamic programming solutions for calculating the total number of good sequences and comparing it with all possible outcomes.

**Required Programming Skills**: **Algorithms & Data Structures**

- Algorithms: The solution might require knowledge of recursion, backtracking, or dynamic programming to explore different possibilities.
- Data Structures: Efficient ways to store intermediate results (like arrays, maps, or vectors), and handling multidimensional grids as input efficiently are essential.

**Complexity**: **Polynomial Time**

The complexity is likely polynomial due to the use of algorithms that need to iterate through possible solutions. For instance, a brute-force solution might be in O(9^3) considering all cells can have values from 1 to 9.

To solve this problem:

1. Understand constraints and conditions carefully.
2. Develop an algorithm to generate or count valid sequences without disappointment.
3. Calculate the total number of all possible ways the numbers could be arranged (which is just permutations).
4. Divide the number of valid sequences by the total arrangements to get the probability.

Remember, this problem might also benefit from a mathematical insight if there's a way to avoid generating all possible sequences through clever combinatorial arguments or formulas.
