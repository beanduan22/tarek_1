Problem ID: abc348_a
Problem Content:
Takahashi will have N penalty kicks in a soccer match.
For the i-th penalty kick, he will fail if i is a multiple of 3, and succeed otherwise.
Print the results of his penalty kicks.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N

Output

Print a string of length N representing the results of Takahashi's penalty kicks. The i-th character (1 \leq i \leq N) should be o if Takahashi succeeds in the i-th penalty kick, and x if he fails.

Constraints


- 1 \leq N \leq 100
- All inputs are integers.

Sample Input 1

7

Sample Output 1

ooxooxo

Takahashi fails the third and sixth penalty kicks, so the third and sixth characters will be x.

Sample Input 2

9

Sample Output 2

ooxooxoox

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the details provided in the question:

1. The problem involves a simple algorithm that processes input (the number of penalty kicks) to generate output (a string indicating successful or failed penalties). This suggests it requires basic understanding and implementation of loops, conditionals, and string handling.

2. It's clear from the sample inputs and outputs that each individual output character depends on its position in the string. Specifically, characters are marked as 'x' for multiples of 3 (indicating failure) and 'o' otherwise (indicating success). This implies that a basic understanding of arithmetic operations (like modulo to check divisibility by 3) is enough.

3. The complexity grows linearly with input size \(N\), meaning the time taken increases proportionally as more penalties are added. This indicates an O(N) algorithm, which can be efficiently computed even for inputs up to \(N = 100\).

4. The solution doesn't require any advanced data structures or complex algorithms beyond basic programming constructs.

Considering these points:

- **Difficulty**: Moderate to Low. The problem is straightforward and can be solved using fundamental programming concepts.
- **Required Skills**: Basic familiarity with loops, conditional statements, string handling, and arithmetic operations.
- **Complexity**: Linear (O(N)). This makes it suitable for beginners who are learning algorithms or as a quick coding challenge.

**Category Prediction**: Based on the analysis:

1. **Educational Setting**: Ideal for introductory programming courses where basic concepts need to be reinforced through practical exercises.
2. **Online Judges and Competitions**: Potentially suited for easy levels in online judge platforms that categorize problems by difficulty, such as Codeforces or LeetCode, under categories like "Beginner" or "Easy".
3. **Interview Preparation**: Could serve as a good practice problem during preparation for technical interviews where the focus is on coding skills rather than complex algorithms.

In summary, this programming question would likely fall into the category of being an "Easy" to "Moderate" level problem suitable for beginners and intermediate programmers looking to sharpen their basic coding skills.
