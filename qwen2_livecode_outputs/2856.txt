Problem ID: 2856
Problem Content:
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.
We call a subarray of an array complete if the following condition is satisfied:

The number of distinct elements in the subarray is equal to the number of distinct elements in the whole array.

Return the number of complete subarrays.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty part of an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The complete subarrays are the following: [1,3,1,2], [1,3,1,2,2], [3,1,2] and [3,1,2,2].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,5,5,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: The array consists only of the integer 5, so any subarray is complete. The number of subarrays that we can choose is 10.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 2000

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the given problem description and constraints, we can categorize this as a **Medium Difficulty** problem. The required programming skills include familiarity with basic concepts of array manipulation and understanding of how to efficiently count distinct elements within subarrays.

The primary challenges involve identifying valid complete subarrays (which require counting distinct elements) and efficiently iterating over all possible subarrays without exceeding time complexity constraints, given the relatively small size of input arrays in this problem. The required algorithm might involve using a sliding window approach combined with hash sets to keep track of unique elements within each potential subarray.

Overall, solving this problem requires solid understanding of array traversals and data structures like hash tables, as well as applying them to find patterns that satisfy the condition for complete subarrays.
