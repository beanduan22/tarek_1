Problem ID: 2884
Problem Content:
You are given a string word and an array of strings forbidden.
A string is called valid if none of its substrings are present in forbidden.
Return the length of the longest valid substring of the string word.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string, possibly empty.
 
Example 1:

Input: word = "cbaaaabc", forbidden = ["aaa","cb"]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 11 valid substrings in word: "c", "b", "a", "ba", "aa", "bc", "baa", "aab", "ab", "abc" and "aabc". The length of the longest valid substring is 4. 
It can be shown that all other substrings contain either "aaa" or "cb" as a substring. 
Example 2:

Input: word = "leetcode", forbidden = ["de","le","e"]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 11 valid substrings in word: "l", "t", "c", "o", "d", "tc", "co", "od", "tco", "cod", and "tcod". The length of the longest valid substring is 4.
It can be shown that all other substrings contain either "de", "le", or "e" as a substring. 

 
Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 10^5
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= forbidden.length <= 10^5
1 <= forbidden[i].length <= 10
forbidden[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided for this problem, we can make some deductions about what category it might fall into:

**Difficulty:** This problem involves string manipulation, searching within strings (forbidden substrings), and could potentially require some form of optimization or greedy approach to find the longest valid substring. The constraints are quite large (`1 <= word.length <= 10^5` for both `word` and `forbidden`, with additional constraints on their lengths), suggesting that a naive solution might not be efficient enough, implying that this problem could be considered medium to hard difficulty.

**Required Programming Skills:** The primary skills required here are familiarity with string processing techniques in the programming language of choice. This includes being able to iterate over strings, perform substring searches efficiently (or find alternatives if brute force is too slow), and perhaps employing some form of state tracking or data structure management to keep track of previously seen substrings that should be avoided.

**Complexity:** The problem asks for the length of the longest valid substring, which implies that one needs to scan through each possible substring in `word` to check if it violates any forbidden patterns. In a naive approach, this could lead to an O(n^3) complexity (where n is the length of `word`) since there are potentially up to `n*(n+1)/2` substrings for a string of length n and we're checking each against all forbidden strings. This indicates that optimizations will likely be needed to achieve acceptable runtime.

**Category Prediction:** Given these factors, this problem leans more towards being categorized as "Dynamic Programming" or "Greedy" if the solution involves building up states based on previous results (e.g., using a trie for efficient substring searches), or it might fall into the category of "String Algorithms" due to its focus on manipulating and searching within strings. It does not strongly align with more complex algorithmic categories like Graphs, Trees, or Sliding Window techniques as explicitly described in the problem statement.

The key takeaways from this analysis are:

- **Algorithm Complexity:** The need for optimization suggests an algorithm that might involve dynamic programming, greedy strategies, hashing, or some form of pattern recognition to efficiently avoid redundant checks.
- **Data Structure Usage:** A Trie (prefix tree) could be beneficial here if the aim is to quickly find substrings in `forbidden` during a scan through each character of `word`.
- **Optimization Techniques:** Efficient string comparison and minimizing unnecessary computations are crucial to solve this problem within reasonable time constraints.

Therefore, categorizing this as an "Intermediate" level problem that requires specific algorithmic skills such as string manipulation and optimization techniques would be appropriate.
