Problem ID: 2802
Problem Content:
Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.
The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:

1 <= i <= n
The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.

 
Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 182
Explanation: There are exactly 3 integers i that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1.
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0.
Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182

Example 2:

Input: n = 37
Output: 1478
Explanation: There are exactly 4 integers i that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. 
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. 
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. 
- 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.
Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

Qwen2 Analysis:
This is a challenging mathematical-computational problem that requires understanding of number theory, string manipulation, dynamic programming or backtracking algorithms.

The problem can be categorized as follows:

1. **Difficulty**: Medium-High - It involves complex conditions, loops to iterate through the input range, and calculations with large numbers (the square root might exceed integer limits).

2. **Required Skills**:
   - Knowledge of number theory: Understanding how to represent and manipulate integers.
   - String manipulation: Being able to split a string into substrings and perform mathematical operations on these substrings is essential for checking the condition about partitioning the square representation of `i`.
   - Algorithmic skills: Implementing a logic that checks all numbers within the given range (`1 <= i <= n`) adheres to specific rules (partitioning and summing substrings).

3. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity might be high due to looping through the entire number range, especially if we are checking each integer's square individually.
   - Space complexity is likely low as it primarily depends on storing integers, which can fit within a few variables.

4. **Solving Strategy**: A brute-force approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `n`, calculating the square (`i * i`) and checking if it can be partitioned according to specified conditions using string manipulation techniques. If yes, add the value of `i` squared to a cumulative sum which is returned as the final result.

5. **Optimization**: Potential optimizations could involve early termination strategies (break out from loop once condition fails for an input), or finding patterns in the numbers that meet the criteria to reduce computations.

In summary, this problem would likely require skills such as dynamic programming (to avoid recalculating if conditions have already been checked against previous results) or backtracking (to backtrack when partitioning conditions are not met). Implementing these might involve complex logic and careful handling of integer arithmetic.
