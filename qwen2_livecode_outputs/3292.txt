Problem ID: 3292
Problem Content:
You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.
Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.
In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:

Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.
If nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].
Do nothing.

Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].
Second 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].
Second 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].
Second 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 7: Do nothing.
Second 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.
Hence, the answer is 8.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3], changeIndices = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2].
Second 2: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,0].
Second 4: Mark the index changeIndices[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,0].
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
Hence, the answer is 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1], changeIndices = [2,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: In this example, it is impossible to mark all indices because index 1 isn't in changeIndices.
Hence, the answer is -1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 2000
0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= m == changeIndices.length <= 2000
1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the analysis of this programming problem:

- **Difficulty**: The problem requires understanding of algorithms, especially optimization techniques to find the earliest second when all indices in the array can be marked optimally. It also requires an understanding of how operations on elements can influence the outcome.

- **Required Programming Skills**: This question involves knowledge of data structures (like arrays and their manipulation), algorithmic thinking, and problem-solving skills focusing on greedy approaches or binary search to find optimal solutions. Understanding and implementing these concepts efficiently in code is crucial.

- **Complexity**: The time complexity depends on how the solution optimizes searching for operations that can mark indices versus performing simple decrement operations. An efficient approach would involve sorting or using a data structure that allows quick retrieval of elements, which could range from O(n log n) to potentially linear time with optimal solutions utilizing specific algorithms.

Based on these factors:
- **Category**: This problem leans towards being categorized under 'Algorithm' and 'Greedy' or 'Dynamic Programming', given the need for efficient operations and optimization. It might also be considered part of the 'Data Structures and Algorithms' category, as it involves choosing the right data structures and applying algorithms to solve a complex problem effectively.

Given these details, this problem could potentially belong in categories such as:

1. **Competitive Programming**
2. **Coding Interviews** (especially those focusing on technical skills assessment)
3. **Algorithm Design & Analysis**

The specific tags would depend on the context of where the question is being used or discussed.
