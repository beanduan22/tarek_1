Problem ID: 3219
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums and a positive integer limit.
In one operation, you can choose any two indices i and j and swap nums[i] and nums[j] if |nums[i] - nums[j]| <= limit.
Return the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained by performing the operation any number of times.
An array a is lexicographically smaller than an array b if in the first position where a and b differ, array a has an element that is less than the corresponding element in b. For example, the array [2,10,3] is lexicographically smaller than the array [10,2,3] because they differ at index 0 and 2 < 10.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,3,9,8], limit = 2
Output: [1,3,5,8,9]
Explanation: Apply the operation 2 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,3,5,9,8]
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. The array becomes [1,3,5,8,9]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.
Note that it may be possible to get the same result by doing different operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,7,6,18,2,1], limit = 3
Output: [1,6,7,18,1,2]
Explanation: Apply the operation 3 times:
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,2,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[4]. The array becomes [2,6,7,18,1,1]
- Swap nums[0] with nums[5]. The array becomes [1,6,7,18,1,2]
We cannot obtain a lexicographically smaller array by applying any more operations.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,7,28,19,10], limit = 3
Output: [1,7,28,19,10]
Explanation: [1,7,28,19,10] is the lexicographically smallest array we can obtain because we cannot apply the operation on any two indices.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= limit <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
This programming problem can be categorized under "Algorithms" with a focus on "Sorting" and "Greedy Algorithms". The difficulty level is considered to be medium-high.

### Problem Category Explanation

1. **Required Programming Skills**:
   - **Understanding Array Manipulation**: You need to effectively manipulate array elements through swapping based on given constraints, indicating proficiency in handling array data structures.
   - **Algorithmic Thinking**: This problem requires devising an algorithm that is efficient and effective with respect to time complexity and space complexity considerations.
   - **Sorting Techniques**: The problem involves generating the lexicographically smallest array which typically suggests sorting as part of the solution approach.

2. **Difficulty Level**:
   - The problem combines multiple concepts (sorting, conditions for swapping elements) making it moderately complex but not overly intricate, hence it falls under medium difficulty.
   - It requires a good balance between understanding constraints and devising an optimal strategy for solving the problem.

3. **Complexity**:
   - **Time Complexity**: Efficient sorting algorithms are required, typically aiming for O(n log n) time complexity in most cases (e.g., using Quick Sort or Merge Sort).
   - **Space Complexity**: The main focus is on algorithmic efficiency rather than space usage because input size constraints allow efficient implementation without requiring additional large data structures.

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - **Greedy Algorithm**: Given the requirement to minimize the array lexicographically, a greedy approach seems suitable as it often involves making locally optimal choices.
   - **Sorting with Constraints**: The problem necessitates sorting but with an added constraint based on 'limit', which requires careful consideration in the sorting phase.

In summary, this problem targets skills related to efficient array manipulation and greedy algorithms while presenting constraints that require a more refined approach than straightforward sorting. It tests one's ability to combine these concepts effectively under time complexity considerations.
