Problem ID: 3384
Problem Content:
You are given a string word of size n, and an integer k such that k divides n.
In one operation, you can pick any two indices i and j, that are divisible by k, then replace the substring of length k starting at i with the substring of length k starting at j. That is, replace the substring word[i..i + k - 1] with the substring word[j..j + k - 1].
Return the minimum number of operations required to make word k-periodic.
We say that word is k-periodic if there is some string s of length k such that word can be obtained by concatenating s an arbitrary number of times. For example, if word == “ababab”, then word is 2-periodic for s = "ab".
 
Example 1:

Input: word = "leetcodeleet", k = 4
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can obtain a 4-periodic string by picking i = 4 and j = 0. After this operation, word becomes equal to "leetleetleet".

Example 2:

Input: word = "leetcoleet", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can obtain a 2-periodic string by applying the operations in the table below.



i
j
word


0
2
etetcoleet


4
0
etetetleet


6
0
etetetetet





 

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == word.length <= 10^5
1 <= k <= word.length
k divides word.length.
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the analysis provided:

- **Difficulty**: The problem seems to have a moderate level of difficulty. It requires understanding string manipulation and efficient algorithms for optimization (since brute force could result in a time complexity that is too high for large inputs).
  
- **Required Programming Skills**:
  - String processing: The task involves manipulating strings by swapping substrings based on index positions.
  - Algorithmic thinking: Efficiently determining the minimum number of operations requires good problem-solving skills to optimize and reduce computational complexity.

- **Complexity**: 
   - Time Complexity: The brute force approach might have a time complexity of O(n^2), which could be inefficient for large inputs. A more optimized solution likely involves hashing or dynamic programming techniques, potentially achieving linear or better complexity.
   - Space Complexity: If using additional data structures like hash maps to store intermediate results, the space complexity might be O(n).

The problem category might fall under **String Manipulation & Algorithmic Optimization**, specifically dealing with string operations and optimization techniques. The focus on finding minimum operations makes it akin to problems found in algorithm design challenges that test understanding of dynamic programming or graph traversal algorithms in their solution approach.
