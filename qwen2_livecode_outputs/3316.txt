Problem ID: 3316
Problem Content:
You are given an integer array nums of length n, and a positive integer k.
The power of a subsequence is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subsequence.
Return the sum of powers of all subsequences of nums which have length equal to k.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are 4 subsequences in nums which have length 3: [1,2,3], [1,3,4], [1,2,4], and [2,3,4]. The sum of powers is |2 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |2 - 1| + |3 - 4| = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
The only subsequence in nums which has length 2 is [2,2]. The sum of powers is |2 - 2| = 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,-1], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation:
There are 3 subsequences in nums which have length 2: [4,3], [4,-1], and [3,-1]. The sum of powers is |4 - 3| + |4 - (-1)| + |3 - (-1)| = 10.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n == nums.length <= 50
-10^8 <= nums[i] <= 10^8 
2 <= k <= n

**Required Skills:**

- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Combinatorics
- Modulo Arithmetic
- Sorting Algorithm for array elements

**Problem Explanation:**

The problem requires us to find the sum of powers for all subsequences in an integer array that has a specific length 'k'. The power is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements within each subsequence.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach**: To solve this efficiently, we need to break down larger problems into smaller subproblems. We can use dynamic programming where at each step, we calculate how many subsequences of size k are possible considering current and previous states.

- **Combinatorics Application**: The problem involves finding combinations (subsets) from the array elements that meet specific criteria ('k' in length). Therefore, understanding combinatorial theory might be helpful to derive an efficient algorithm. For example, calculating binomial coefficients can help determine the number of ways to choose 'k' elements from 'n'.

- **Modulo Arithmetic**: The problem requires returning the result modulo 10^9 +7. This is crucial as it affects how we handle large numbers and ensure that overflow doesn't occur during computations.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(n * k) due to iterating through all possible combinations of array elements for subsequences of size 'k'. 
- Space Complexity: Depending on the implementation details, it can vary. For example, if using a DP table, it would be O(k).

The problem is medium in difficulty because it combines multiple concepts and requires careful reasoning about subproblems, combinatorics, and efficient computation methods to handle large numbers under modulo constraints.

**Suggested Approach:**

1. Sort the array first.
2. Use dynamic programming to find all subsequences of length 'k'.
3. Calculate powers for each valid subsequence (minimum absolute difference).
4. Sum up these powers while handling modulo arithmetic throughout calculations to avoid overflow and obtain the final answer.


In summary, this problem requires a good understanding of Dynamic Programming strategies combined with principles from Combinatorics and efficient Modulo Arithmetic techniques to find the solution within constraints on time and space complexity.
