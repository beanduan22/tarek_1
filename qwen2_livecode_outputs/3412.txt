Problem ID: 3412
Problem Content:
You are given two strings s and t such that every character occurs at most once in s and t is a permutation of s.
The permutation difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each character in s and the index of the occurrence of the same character in t.
Return the permutation difference between s and t.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "bac"
Output: 2
Explanation:
For s = "abc" and t = "bac", the permutation difference of s and t is equal to the sum of:

The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "a" in s and the index of the occurrence of "a" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "b" in s and the index of the occurrence of "b" in t.
The absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of "c" in s and the index of the occurrence of "c" in t.

That is, the permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 1| + |2 - 2| + |1 - 0| = 2.

Example 2:

Input: s = "abcde", t = "edbac"
Output: 12
Explanation: The permutation difference between s and t is equal to |0 - 3| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 4| + |3 - 1| + |4 - 0| = 12.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 26
Each character occurs at most once in s.
t is a permutation of s.
s consists only of lowercase English letters.

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem involves finding the "permutation difference" between two strings. It requires understanding string manipulation, character indexing, absolute values, and basic mathematical operations like addition in a specific context.

**Category Prediction:**

1. **Difficulty**: The problem is of medium difficulty as it involves both algorithmic thinking to understand how permutations are compared through indices and some level of mathematics for calculating the absolute differences between index positions.

2. **Required Programming Skills**: 
   - String manipulation techniques
   - Knowledge of indexing in sequences (like array or string)
   - Understanding of absolute values and their usage in calculations

3. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity would depend on how the indices are calculated for each character, but since there is only one-to-one correspondence between characters in `s` and `t`, this process can be considered linear relative to the length of `s`.
   - Space complexity would likely be constant as we may store a dictionary or hash map for the mapping from characters to their respective indices.

**Conclusion**: This problem falls under the category of **"Algorithmic Problem Solving"**, particularly focusing on string manipulation and basic arithmetic operations. It is suitable for candidates who have good familiarity with these areas, aiming to develop efficient algorithms to compute differences based on character positions in strings.

To solve this problem efficiently:

- First, create a dictionary/ hash map to store the index of each character from `s` (since characters occur at most once).
- Then, iterate through string `t`, find the index for each character using the precomputed dictionary, calculate its absolute difference with the stored index and add it to the result.
- Finally, return the computed permutation difference.

This approach ensures that all possible comparisons are made efficiently, maintaining a linear time complexity relative to the length of string `s`.
