Problem ID: abc335_a
Problem Content:
You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.
S is guaranteed to end with 2023.
Change the last character of S to 4 and print the modified string.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 4 and 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.
- S ends with 2023.

Sample Input 1

hello2023

Sample Output 1

hello2024

Changing the last character of hello2023 to 4 yields hello2024.

Sample Input 2

worldtourfinals2023

Sample Output 2

worldtourfinals2024

Sample Input 3

2023

Sample Output 3

2024

S is guaranteed to end with 2023, possibly being 2023 itself.

Sample Input 4

20232023

Sample Output 4

20232024

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description of this problem:

- **Difficulty**: The task involves string manipulation which is a fundamental skill in programming. No complex algorithms or data structures are needed, making it relatively easy compared to problems that require those concepts.

- **Required Programming Skills**: Basic programming skills are sufficient, including familiarity with strings and loops (since we're iterating over characters). No advanced language features like recursion or concurrency are necessary.

- **Complexity**: The problem has a linear complexity in terms of time as you iterate through the string once to find the last character. Space complexity is minimal since it just involves storing the modified string which can't exceed the length of the input string (which is guaranteed by constraints).

Thus, this problem would likely fall into the category of **Easy** or **Beginner Level**, requiring skills typically taught in an introductory programming course.
