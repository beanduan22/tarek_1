Problem ID: abc312_a
Problem Content:
Given a length-3 string S consisting of uppercase English letters, print Yes if S equals one of ACE, BDF, CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, and GBD; print No otherwise.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print Yes if S equals one of ACE, BDF, CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, and GBD; print No otherwise.

Constraints


- S is a length-3 string consisting of uppercase English letters.

Sample Input 1

ABC

Sample Output 1

No

When S = ABC, S does not equal any of ACE, BDF, CEG, DFA, EGB, FAC, and GBD, so No should be printed.

Sample Input 2

FAC

Sample Output 2

Yes

Sample Input 3

XYX

Sample Output 3

No

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description of this problem:

- **Difficulty**: The problem seems to be of medium difficulty since it requires understanding specific input-output requirements related to strings in comparison rather than advanced algorithmic concepts. 

- **Required Programming Skills**: Basic string manipulation is needed here, which includes things like accessing characters within a string and comparing values (in this case, uppercase English letters).

- **Complexity**: The complexity of the solution is linear time complexity as it involves checking if the given input matches any predefined strings (which can be considered constant size), making it O(1). 

Given these factors:

Category: This problem could be categorized under "Basic String Manipulation" or "Simple Comparisons". It might appear in an introductory programming course to help students practice working with strings and conditional logic.

The main skills being tested are understanding how to work with string data types, using if-else statements for comparisons, and possibly the use of loops (though not necessary for this problem since there's only a constant number of conditions to check). Students should also understand that in programming, direct comparison can be used to determine equality or inequality between strings.
