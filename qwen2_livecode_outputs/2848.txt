Problem ID: 2848
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing n distinct positive integers. A permutation of nums is called special if:

For all indexes 0 <= i < n - 1, either nums[i] % nums[i+1] == 0 or nums[i+1] % nums[i] == 0.

Return the total number of special permutations. As the answer could be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: 2
Explanation: [3,6,2] and [2,6,3] are the two special permutations of nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: [3,1,4] and [4,1,3] are the two special permutations of nums.

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 14
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided for this programming problem, I can predict several details about its category:

### Difficulty Level:
The problem involves understanding constraints, analyzing permutations, and applying arithmetic operations within an array. The requirement to find all special permutations under specific conditions suggests it's a combinatorics or mathematical problem that combines elements of algorithm design and computational thinking.

### Required Programming Skills:
- **Understanding and manipulating arrays:** This is crucial as the input is given in the form of an integer array.
- **Logical reasoning and condition checking:** The problem involves multiple conditional checks (divisibility, order constraints) to determine if a permutation is "special."
- **Recursion or dynamic programming:** Depending on how one approaches solving this problem, there might be an element of recursion or using dynamic programming techniques to avoid recalculating solutions for subproblems.

### Complexity:
The complexity could range from O(N!) (considering brute force approaches that check every possible permutation) to potentially better with optimization strategies like memoization or a more efficient algorithm design. Since the constraints are relatively small (up to 14 elements), this problem is likely to be solvable within reasonable time limits for most programming languages.

### Problem Category:
Given these characteristics, the problem can be categorized as:

- **Mathematics/Combinatorics:** The focus on permutations and conditions based on mathematical operations suggests a strong mathematical component.
- **Algorithm Design:** Specifically, algorithmic approaches such as recursion or dynamic programming might be necessary to efficiently find all valid special permutations within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
This problem leans towards being part of the "algorithm design" category with a specific focus on combinatorial logic and number manipulation. It requires not only understanding the underlying mathematical principles but also applying algorithmic strategies effectively to handle the permutation generation and validation process, making it an interesting challenge that tests both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills.
