Problem ID: abc315_a
Problem Content:
You are given a string S consisting of lowercase English letters.
Remove all occurrences of a, e, i, o, u from S and print the resulting string.
S contains at least one character other than a, e, i, o, u.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
S

Output

Print the answer.

Constraints


- S is a string of length between 1 and 100, inclusive, consisting of lowercase English letters.
- S contains at least one character other than a, e, i, o, u.

Sample Input 1

atcoder

Sample Output 1

tcdr

For S = atcoder, remove the 1-st, 4-th, and 6-th characters to get tcdr.

Sample Input 2

xyz

Sample Output 2

xyz

Sample Input 3

aaaabbbbcccc

Sample Output 3

bbbbcccc

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem can be categorized as a **Basic String Manipulation** problem with a **Light Complexity Level**. The primary skills required involve understanding string operations in your chosen programming language and applying them efficiently to filter out specific characters from the input.

The requirements include:
1. Reading input as a string.
2. Identifying and removing ('filtering out') certain characters (a, e, i, o, u) from the string.
3. Outputting the remaining characters in their original order.

This problem tests basic programming skills such as string handling and character filtering but does not involve complex algorithms or data structures. It is suitable for beginners learning to manipulate strings or for interview preparation where fundamental skills are being tested.
