Problem ID: 3397
Problem Content:
You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.
Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.
As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.
Return the integer x.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,6,4], nums2 = [9,7,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The integer added to each element of nums1 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [10], nums2 = [5]
Output: -5
Explanation:
The integer added to each element of nums1 is -5.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,1,1,1], nums2 = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The integer added to each element of nums1 is 0.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length == nums2.length <= 100
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer x such that nums1 can become equal to nums2 by adding x to each element of nums1.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem falls under the category of **Algorithms** with a focus on **Arrays**, **Maths**, and **Sorting**. It requires understanding array manipulation, basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction), and potentially sorting techniques to identify patterns or differences between two arrays.

**Difficulty Level:**
- **Beginner:** The problem involves straightforward concepts but requires careful implementation and attention to detail.
- **Intermediate:** Although it's not overly complex, it might challenge someone who is new to coding by making them think about data structures (arrays) and their manipulation in a more structured way.

**Required Programming Skills:**
- **Basic programming knowledge:** Understanding loops, arrays, variables, and operations.
- **Logical reasoning:** Ability to logically analyze the problem and devise an algorithmic solution.
- **Mathematical understanding:** Basic arithmetic operations and logic related to comparing numbers.

**Complexity:**
The time complexity of this problem would be O(n log n) due to sorting or O(n) if you use other efficient techniques like hash maps to count occurrences. The space complexity could vary depending on the approach taken but is generally manageable with common data structures.

**Approach Outline:**
1. **Identify Differences:** Find the differences between corresponding elements in nums1 and nums2.
2. **Calculate Average Difference:** Compute the average of these differences, which should ideally give you x since nums1 was manipulated by adding/subtracting x from each element to match nums2.
3. **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider scenarios where all elements are equal (x=0) or when dealing with negative numbers.

**Code Sample in Python:**
```python
def find_x(nums1, nums2):
    differences = [a - b for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]
    return sum(differences) // len(nums1)
```

This code leverages list comprehension to calculate the differences between corresponding elements and then calculates their average using Python's `sum` function. The result is divided by the length of either array (assuming they are equal as per problem constraints).

**Educational Value:**
Solving this problem helps reinforce skills in iterating over arrays, performing arithmetic operations on data, understanding the impact of different operations on numerical sequences and potentially introduces concepts like sorting and algorithms related to finding averages or patterns in data.
