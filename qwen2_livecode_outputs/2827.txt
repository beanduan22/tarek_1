Problem ID: 2827
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and you are allowed to traverse between its indices. You can traverse between index i and index j, i != j, if and only if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor.
Your task is to determine if for every pair of indices i and j in nums, where i < j, there exists a sequence of traversals that can take us from i to j.
Return true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: true
Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,9,5]
Output: false
Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,12,8]
Output: true
Explanation: There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Qwen2 Analysis:
This is a challenging problem that combines concepts from graph theory (network traversal) and number theory (greatest common divisor or gcd).

**Category:**
- **Difficulty:** Hard. This requires knowledge of both graph traversal techniques (DFS or BFS for traversing all nodes reachable under certain conditions), as well as the efficient computation of greatest common divisors which can involve either simple loops, recursive algorithms like Euclidean GCD algorithm, or more advanced number theory concepts.
- **Required Programming Skills:** Strong background in graph algorithms and number theory is necessary. Experience with recursion and iterative programming constructs such as loops would also be useful.
- **Complexity:** The problem requires careful reasoning about the conditions under which traversal between nodes (indices) is possible. It involves checking adjacency of indices based on their gcd, which necessitates efficient computation to avoid excessive time complexity.

**Solution Approach:**
The solution likely involves constructing a graph where each node represents an index in `nums`, and edges connect pairs of nodes whose corresponding numbers have a GCD greater than 1. The task is then reduced to determining whether the graph constructed this way is fully connectedâ€”meaning there's a path between any two nodes.

To solve this problem, you might implement:
- **Graph Construction:** Use an adjacency list or matrix to represent connections between indices based on their gcd.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traverse the graph starting from each node, marking visited nodes. If at any point it's possible to visit all nodes through DFS/BFS without missing any index, return `true`. Otherwise, if there exists an unvisited node after trying all indices as start points, return `false`.

This approach requires efficient gcd computation and careful management of traversal logic within a graph structure. The solution must handle large input sizes efficiently and ensure that no unnecessary steps are taken for traversals.

In summary, this problem falls into the category of advanced algorithmic challenges that require deep understanding of both graph algorithms (to represent relationships between elements) and number theory (for calculating GCDs). It's designed to test skills in designing efficient graph traversal strategies while dealing with large data sizes.
