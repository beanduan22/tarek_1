Problem Content:
Given a 0-indexed string s, repeatedly perform the following operation any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string, and let c be the character in position i. Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if any) and the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if any).

Your task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operation any number of times.
Return an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "aaabc"
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, s is "aaabc". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes "abc". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 3
Explanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes "cbd" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3. 

Example 3:

Input: s = "dddaaa"
Output: 2
Explanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes "daaa". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes "da". We cannot minimize this further, so the minimized length is 2.

 
 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s contains only lowercase English letters

Qwen2 Analysis:
**Category Prediction:**

This problem falls under **Algorithms**, specifically focusing on string manipulation and greedy strategy. The difficulty level can be considered medium to high, depending on prior knowledge in these areas.

- **Required Programming Skills**: Basic understanding of string handling in the language you're using, familiarity with loops (for iterating through characters), conditional statements for decision-making based on character occurrences, and potentially recursion or stack-based approaches for more complex implementations. Algorithmic thinking is crucial to devise an efficient solution, as manually removing elements at each step isn't feasible due to constraints.

- **Complexity**: The problem's complexity involves multiple steps of analysis (identifying repeating characters), iteration over the string, and making decisions based on specific conditions (presence of closest occurrences to left or right). It does not require advanced data structures like trees or graphs but rather focuses on string traversal techniques and pattern recognition.

Given these factors:

- **Category**: This problem is best categorized under "String Algorithms" with a focus on "Greedy Approach". The solution requires identifying patterns and making decisions based on character occurrences within the string, which is a typical characteristic of problems solvable using greedy strategies.

Thus, it would be appropriate to classify this as an intermediate-level question in the context of algorithmic challenges, particularly those involving strings.
