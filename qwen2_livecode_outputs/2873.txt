Problem ID: 2873
Problem Content:
You are given an integer n. We say that two integers x and y form a prime number pair if:

1 <= x <= y <= n
x + y == n
x and y are prime numbers

Return the 2D sorted list of prime number pairs [x_i, y_i]. The list should be sorted in increasing order of x_i. If there are no prime number pairs at all, return an empty array.
Note: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 with only two factors, itself and 1.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: [[3,7],[5,5]]
Explanation: In this example, there are two prime pairs that satisfy the criteria. 
These pairs are [3,7] and [5,5], and we return them in the sorted order as described in the problem statement.

Example 2:

Input: n = 2
Output: []
Explanation: We can show that there is no prime number pair that gives a sum of 2, so we return an empty array. 

 
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^6

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given programming problem falls under the category of **Medium Difficulty**, focusing on **Algorithms** specifically related to Prime Numbers.

### Required Programming Skills:

- **Understanding of prime numbers**: The ability to determine if a number is prime or not. This usually involves iterating through possible factors and checking divisibility.
  
- **Algorithmic efficiency**: Since n can go up to \(10^6\), brute-force approaches might be too slow, so efficient algorithms are needed for identifying primes within this range.

### Problem Complexity:

The problem requires generating all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`, which is an essential step. Moreover, the operation involves comparing pairs of these numbers that sum up to `n`. Efficiently iterating through potential candidates and utilizing optimizations like the Sieve of Eratosthenes for identifying primes can significantly reduce computational complexity.

### Optimization:

- **Space**: The problem requires returning a 2D array or list which has an O(n) space requirement due to storing prime pairs. 

- **Time**: For larger `n`, efficient algorithms are crucial, aiming at reducing the time complexity from \(O(n^2)\) (brute force checking each pair) to something more optimal.

In summary, this problem is designed to test and improve skills in dealing with large numbers efficiently, understanding prime number properties, and optimizing algorithms. Solving it will likely involve techniques such as sieving for primes followed by checking pairs that meet the criteria, requiring careful consideration of both time and space complexities.
