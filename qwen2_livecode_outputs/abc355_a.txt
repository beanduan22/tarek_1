Problem ID: abc355_a
Problem Content:
Takahashi's cake has been eaten by someone. There are three suspects: person 1, person 2, and person 3.
There are two witnesses, Ringo and Snuke. Ringo remembers that person A is not the culprit, and Snuke remembers that person B is not the culprit.
Determine if the culprit can be uniquely identified based on the memories of the two witnesses. If the culprit can be identified, print the person's number.

Input

The input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
A B

Output

If the culprit can be uniquely identified based on the memories of the two witnesses, print the person's number; otherwise, print -1.

Constraints


- 1 \leq A, B \leq 3
- All input values are integers.

Sample Input 1

1 2

Sample Output 1

3

From the memories of the two witnesses, it can be determined that person 3 is the culprit.

Sample Input 2

1 1

Sample Output 2

-1

From the memories of the two witnesses, it cannot be determined whether person 2 or person 3 is the culprit. Therefore, print -1.

Sample Input 3

3 1

Sample Output 3

2

Qwen2 Analysis:
The given problem seems to fall under the category of "Logical Reasoning" or "Constraint Satisfaction". The requirements include understanding of logical deduction and constraints satisfaction which is usually associated with problems that require decision making based on conditions and rules. This isn't a high-level computational difficulty level problem but rather more related to fundamental programming skills like conditional logic, boolean operations and basic arithmetic.

The required programming skills primarily involve:
1) Basic Understanding of Programming: The solution could be done in any language though most straightforward implementations might use Python as it supports easy manipulation with variables.
2) Conditional Logic: Writing conditions that check if the culprit can be uniquely identified based on the memories of Ringo and Snuke.
3) Simple Arithmetic: Not much arithmetic involved but the ability to perform simple calculations such as comparison operations will help.

The complexity here would mainly revolve around understanding and applying logical deductions rather than any complex algorithmic steps or data structures. The time complexity is O(1), since it involves a fixed number of conditions being checked regardless of input size, and space complexity can be considered O(1) due to limited data storage needs.

Therefore, this problem could be categorized as an Easy to Medium difficulty level based on the skills required and the nature of the task.
