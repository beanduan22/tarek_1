Problem ID: 3226
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of even length and there is also an empty array arr. Alice and Bob decided to play a game where in every round Alice and Bob will do one move. The rules of the game are as follows:

Every round, first Alice will remove the minimum element from nums, and then Bob does the same.
Now, first Bob will append the removed element in the array arr, and then Alice does the same.
The game continues until nums becomes empty.

Return the resulting array arr.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,4,2,3]
Output: [3,2,5,4]
Explanation: In round one, first Alice removes 2 and then Bob removes 3. Then in arr firstly Bob appends 3 and then Alice appends 2. So arr = [3,2].
At the begining of round two, nums = [5,4]. Now, first Alice removes 4 and then Bob removes 5. Then both append in arr which becomes [3,2,5,4].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5]
Output: [5,2]
Explanation: In round one, first Alice removes 2 and then Bob removes 5. Then in arr firstly Bob appends and then Alice appends. So arr = [5,2].

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums.length % 2 == 0

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided, this is a programming problem that involves sorting and array manipulation. The key elements of this problem are:

1. **Input**: An integer array `nums` with even length. This implies that there will be an equal number of elements to be played by Alice and Bob in turns.

2. **Processing**:
   - Alice removes the smallest element from the current list.
   - Then, Bob does the same operation (removes the next smallest element).

   After each removal, Alice appends her chosen element to array `arr`, followed by Bob doing the same.

3. **Output**: The resulting array `arr` after all rounds are completed.

4. **Constraints**:
   - Length of input array is between 2 and 100.
   - Each element in the array can be any integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - The length of the input array will always be even, meaning that both Alice and Bob have an equal number of turns.

**Analysis**:
- This problem requires basic programming skills such as array manipulation and understanding of loops (for Alice and Bob to alternate moves).
- The difficulty could vary depending on how well a candidate understands the concept of using arrays for storing sequences of elements in order or by value, performing removals based on certain conditions.
- Efficiency might not be a major concern here since the constraints are relatively small (maximum length is 100), which makes it an acceptable problem even for less optimized solutions.

**Category**: This problem could be categorized under **"Data Structures and Algorithms"**, specifically focusing on **Array Manipulation** and **Sorting**. It might also fall under **"Simulation"** as the process involves simulating game rules through code execution, making decisions based on predefined logic (e.g., who makes moves in sequence).

**Skills Required**: Basic programming skills for iterating over arrays, sorting if necessary, and understanding of control structures like loops and conditional statements.

**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the sort operation (assuming the numbers are sorted during the rounds), where 'n' is the number of elements. However, since `n` is constrained to 100 or less, this complexity might not matter for most applications unless dealing with extremely large data sets.

**Space Complexity**: O(n) as it requires additional space proportional to the size of the input array (`nums`) and potentially a stack for recursion if using that approach instead of iterative methods. 

In summary, this is an introductory level problem in programming, requiring understanding of basic concepts like loops, arrays, and sorting algorithms, making it suitable for beginners or as part of an interview process where foundational coding skills are being evaluated.
