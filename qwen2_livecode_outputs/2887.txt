Problem ID: 2887
Problem Content:
Given a 0-indexed string s, permute s to get a new string t such that:

All consonants remain in their original places. More formally, if there is an index i with 0 <= i < s.length such that s[i] is a consonant, then t[i] = s[i].
The vowels must be sorted in the nondecreasing order of their ASCII values. More formally, for pairs of indices i, j with 0 <= i < j < s.length such that s[i] and s[j] are vowels, then t[i] must not have a higher ASCII value than t[j].

Return the resulting string.
The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in lowercase or uppercase. Consonants comprise all letters that are not vowels.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "lEetcOde"
Output: "lEOtcede"
Explanation: 'E', 'O', and 'e' are the vowels in s; 'l', 't', 'c', and 'd' are all consonants. The vowels are sorted according to their ASCII values, and the consonants remain in the same places.

Example 2:

Input: s = "lYmpH"
Output: "lYmpH"
Explanation: There are no vowels in s (all characters in s are consonants), so we return "lYmpH".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s consists only of letters of the English alphabet in uppercase and lowercase.

Qwen2 Analysis:
This problem can be categorized as an algorithmic challenge that requires a combination of string manipulation, character classification (vowel/consonant), sorting, and possibly some form of in-place modification or data structure usage. Here's how to break it down based on the factors you mentioned:

### Difficulty Level

**Easy to Medium**: This problem is somewhat straightforward for someone with basic programming skills but requires careful attention to detail and understanding of specific conditions (such as handling both uppercase and lowercase vowels, and sorting in a non-decreasing order).

### Required Programming Skills

1. **String Manipulation**: You'll need to interact directly with the string characters.
2. **Character Classification**: Identifying whether each character is a vowel or a consonant requires knowledge of the alphabet's structure.
3. **Sorting**: The requirement to sort vowels in non-decreasing order means you should be familiar with basic sorting concepts.

### Complexity

**Time Complexity**: Sorting the vowels can potentially take O(n log n) time if using an efficient sorting algorithm (like quicksort or mergesort), where n is the length of the string. However, since we're only sorting vowels and not changing their order relative to consonants, this might simplify to more like O(n). The overall process should be linear.

**Space Complexity**: If you modify the input string in-place by moving characters around instead of creating a new one (which is common for problems requiring modifying existing strings), space complexity would be close to constant. Otherwise, if using an additional structure for sorting vowels before insertion back into the original string, it could depend on how efficiently that operation is performed.

### Algorithmic Approach

1. **Character Classification**: Iterate through the input string and categorize each character as either a vowel or a consonant.
2. **Sorting Vowels**: Collect all vowels in an array (or a similar data structure like a list) while preserving their order based on ASCII values.
3. **Reconstructing the String**: Iterate over the original string again, replacing consonants directly and inserting sorted vowels at their correct positions.

### Additional Considerations

- **Handling Case Sensitivity**: The problem specifies to handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels equally (assuming 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' are considered regardless of case).
- **ASCII Value Sorting**: Sorting based on ASCII values requires an understanding that the sorting might be done in ascending order for non-decreasing sequence.

Overall, this problem doesn't delve deeply into complex data structures or advanced algorithms; it leans more towards clear algorithmic thinking and careful implementation. It's a good fit for someone looking to improve their skills in string manipulation and basic algorithmic challenges within programming interviews or as part of coding assessments.
