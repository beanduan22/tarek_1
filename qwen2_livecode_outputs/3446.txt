Problem ID: 3446
Problem Content:
You are given 2 integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of lengths n and m respectively. You are also given a positive integer k.
A pair (i, j) is called good if nums1[i] is divisible by nums2[j] * k (0 <= i <= n - 1, 0 <= j <= m - 1).
Return the total number of good pairs.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3,4], nums2 = [1,3,4], k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation:
The 5 good pairs are (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), and (2, 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,4,12], nums2 = [2,4], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
The 2 good pairs are (3, 0) and (3, 1).

 
Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 50
1 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 50
1 <= k <= 50

Qwen2 Analysis:
The problem can be categorized as an intermediate-level question under Data Structures & Algorithms.

Category: **Data Structures & Algorithms**
Difficulty Level: **Medium**
Required Programming Skills:
1. **Understanding of Loops**: To iterate over the arrays to find all possible pairs (0-indexed for simplicity).
2. **Conditional Statements**: To check if `nums1[i]` is divisible by `nums2[j] * k`.
3. **Basic Array Manipulation**: To work with the input data.
4. **Counting Logic**: Counting the number of good pairs that satisfy the given condition.

Complexity:
**Time Complexity:** O(n*m), since we are iterating through both arrays to find all possible pairs and checking each pair for the divisibility condition.
**Space Complexity:** O(1) as there is no usage of extra space proportional to input size.

The solution involves straightforward iteration over two arrays. The major focus here is on understanding how to iterate efficiently over multiple collections and apply a conditional check across those iterations.
