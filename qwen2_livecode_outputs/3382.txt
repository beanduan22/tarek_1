Problem ID: 3382
Problem Content:
You are given an array of positive integers nums.
Return the number of subarrays of nums, where the first and the last elements of the subarray are equal to the largest element in the subarray.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 4. The first element is 4 and the last element is also 4.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 2. The first element is 2 and the last element is also 2.
subarray [1,4,3,3,2], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.

Hence, we return 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,3]
Output: 6
Explanation:
There are 6 subarrays which have the first and the last elements equal to the largest element of the subarray:

subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.
subarray [3,3,3], with its largest element 3. The first element is 3 and the last element is also 3.

Hence, we return 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is a single subarray of nums which is [1], with its largest element 1. The first element is 1 and the last element is also 1.
Hence, we return 1.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

Qwen2 Analysis:
Category: Algorithms / Array / Sliding Window / Counting 

Difficulty: Medium-Hard

Required Programming Skills: 
- Understanding of array manipulation
- Ability to work with subarrays
- Implementation of efficient loop structures (e.g., for loops)
- Ability to utilize conditional statements effectively
- Basic knowledge of mathematical operations in programming languages

Complexity:
The problem involves iterating through the array, finding maximum elements within each subarray formed by adjacent equal maximum values. This process requires careful handling of edge cases and might involve using a sliding window technique.

As such, this question is typically placed in the medium-hard difficulty category because it combines concepts from multiple areas (arrays, loops, conditionals) while also requiring an efficient approach to count the required subarrays without explicitly creating all possible subarrays. The problem's time complexity would be linear with respect to input size `n`, as each element needs to be visited at most twice during two separate passes for checking maxima and counting subarrays.

In terms of implementation, one might consider:
1. Finding sequences where the first and last elements are equal (`max_element`).
2. Counting these specific subarray types efficiently by utilizing a sliding window technique or another suitable approach.
3. Handling edge cases like empty arrays or all elements being unique.

The problem doesn't involve recursion (which would typically increase complexity), sorting (which could potentially decrease the efficiency), or complex data structures, making it more about algorithmic thinking and implementation rather than advanced data structure manipulation techniques.

To solve this problem efficiently without creating all subarrays explicitly:
- Iterate through each element in the array.
- Keep track of maximum value encountered so far (`max_element`).
- When a new maximum is found, check if both ends are equal to `max_element`. If yes, increment count as you move forward until the next distinct element (or end of list).

The solution requires understanding of arrays, loops, and conditional logic. However, it can be solved with basic programming knowledge by breaking down the problem step-by-step and implementing the logic carefully.

This question falls under the categories of Array Problems and Sliding Window since its essence revolves around manipulating elements within an array to find subarrays meeting certain criteria efficiently through a window that slides across the data structure. The solution's time complexity is linear (`O(n)`), which aligns well with the problem constraints given in terms of input size.

In summary, this question is designed for developers who are familiar with basic programming constructs and can effectively apply concepts like loops, conditionals, and array manipulation to solve a more structured problem that requires a bit more thought beyond just direct implementation.
