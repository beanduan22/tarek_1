Problem ID: 3055
Problem Content:
You are given a binary string s that contains at least one '1'.
You have to rearrange the bits in such a way that the resulting binary number is the maximum odd binary number that can be created from this combination.
Return a string representing the maximum odd binary number that can be created from the given combination.
Note that the resulting string can have leading zeros.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = "010"
Output: "001"
Explanation: Because there is just one '1', it must be in the last position. So the answer is "001".

Example 2:

Input: s = "0101"
Output: "1001"
Explanation: One of the '1's must be in the last position. The maximum number that can be made with the remaining digits is "100". So the answer is "1001".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of '0' and '1'.
s contains at least one '1'.

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description provided for this problem - involving string manipulation, bit shifting or binary number operations, as well as a certain level of decision-making process due to the requirement of creating maximum odd binary numbers from given combination, it can be categorized as an **Easy** level programming problem.

The skills required are primarily focused around basic understanding and implementation of binary representation in strings, knowledge about string manipulation (rearranging characters), and logical thinking for determining how to place bits to form a larger number that meets the specified criteria.

In terms of complexity, the solution involves iterating through the input string once to count '1's and to identify where to place them ('0's), which makes it a linear time complexity problem (`O(n)`). The space complexity is also `O(n)`, assuming for worst case scenario when we need to store all bits as separate characters in our result, but could be considered `O(1)` if using built-in string operations since the amount of memory usage does not grow with the size of the input.

In summary, this problem can be solved with straightforward logic and basic programming skills without requiring advanced data structures or complex algorithms. It is suitable for beginners who have a grasp on basic syntax and are learning to manipulate strings and perform simple arithmetic operations in their preferred language.
