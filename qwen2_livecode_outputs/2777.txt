Problem ID: 2777
Problem Content:
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n.
The distinct difference array of nums is an array diff of length n such that diff[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix nums[i + 1, ..., n - 1] subtracted from the number of distinct elements in the prefix nums[0, ..., i].
Return the distinct difference array of nums.
Note that nums[i, ..., j] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index i and ending at index j inclusive. Particularly, if i > j then nums[i, ..., j] denotes an empty subarray.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 3 - 2 = 1.
For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.
For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,4,2]
Output: [-2,-1,0,2,3]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 3 = -2.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.
For index i = 2, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 2 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[2] = 2 - 2 = 0.
For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.
For index i = 4, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 3 - 0 = 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= n == nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

Qwen2 Analysis:
Based on the description of this problem, it appears to be a simple mathematical algorithmic problem that involves operations with arrays and sets in computer science. The primary tasks are:

1. Compute the number of distinct elements within prefixes (elements before index `i`) and suffixes (elements after index `i`).
2. Subtract the number of distinct elements in each suffix from each prefix.

These computations involve iterating over an array, maintaining counts or tracking unique elements seen so far using data structures like sets or maps.

The required programming skills include:

- Basic understanding of arrays
- Ability to iterate and traverse through a list 
- Use of data structures such as sets for counting unique values

Considering the nature of this problem - which involves simple operations on an array, maintaining counts, and using iteration - I would categorize it under "Easy" or "Medium" difficulty level within programming challenges.

The problem is not inherently complex in terms of algorithmic complexity (like O(n^2), recursion depth, etc.) but might require careful handling of cases when calculating distinct differences between prefix and suffixes. Thus, the difficulty could depend on whether someone can handle efficiently iterating through arrays and performing necessary calculations without bugs or unnecessary overhead.

In summary:
- Difficulty level: Easy to Medium
- Required skills: Basic programming knowledge, proficiency with data structures like sets for counting elements, iteration capabilities using loops in any language of choice.
- Complexity: Linear O(n), where n is the length of the array. 

This problem suits beginners looking to practice basic algorithmic skills and understand how to manipulate arrays effectively while keeping track of counts or unique values through appropriate data structures.
